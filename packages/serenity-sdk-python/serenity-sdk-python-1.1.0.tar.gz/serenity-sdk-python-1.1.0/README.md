## Serenity SDK - Python

### Introduction

The Serenity digital asset risk platform exposes all functionality via an API -- currently REST only.

Although it's possible to call the API with simple HTTP client code in most any modern language, there are conventions that need to be followed -- especially for authentication and authorization -- and to make it easier we have provided this lightweight SDK.

### Installation

Installation for Python 3.x users is very simple using pip:

```plain
pip install serenity.sdk.python
```

If you have already installed the SDK and want to upgrade to latest:

```plain
pip install -U serenity.sdk.python
```

### API documentation

The latest API documentation is always available at [ReadTheDocs](https://cloudwall-serenitysdkpython.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/).
