    :param lookback_days: The lookback period expressed in days.

    ## Notes on the parameters

    ### The lookback days parameter

    The term "lookback_days" refers to the time period over which historical data is considered when computing risk.
    It represents the number of days in the past that are taken into account for analyzing and calculating risk.
    In risk analysis, historical data is often used to assess the probability and potential impact of future events
    or outcomes. By examining past data, patterns, and trends, you can gain insights into the potential risks
    associated with a particular system, investment, or activity.
    The "lookback_days" parameter allows you to specify how far back in time you want to analyze historical data
    when calculating risk. For example, if you set "lookback_days" to 360, it means you are considering the data
    from the past year for risk assessment.
    The appropriate value for "lookback_days" depends on the specific context and requirements of your risk
    calculation, however setting the "lookback_days" parameter to 360 is a good starting point for in most cases.

    ### The sampling hours parameter

    The term "sampling_hours" typically refers to the time interval between each sample when computing risk. It
    represents the duration for which data is collected or observed to analyze and calculate risk. For example,
    in the context of your hourly samples, the "sampling_hours" would be 1 hour since you are collecting data on an
    hourly basis. Each sample represents a data point collected at a specific hour, and the "sampling_hours"
    indicates the time span between consecutive samples. If daily samples are collected, then the "sampling_hours"
    would be 24 hours. Each sample represents a data point collected. In order to increase the accuracy of your
    distribution, the advice is to keep the "sampling_hours" as low as possible. The "sampling_hours" value  of 1
    hour is a good starting point for most cases. In case that daily scenarios are needed, the advice is to still
    keep the "sampling_hours" as 1 and to set the "horizon_scale" to 24.

    ### The horizon scale parameter

    The term "horizon_scale" refers to the time period or duration over which the risk is projected. It represents
    the length of time, in "sampling_hours", for which the risk assessment is made.
    The "horizon_scale" parameter allows you to specify the desired time horizon for risk analysis. It determines
    the timeframe within which the risks and their associated probabilities and impacts are evaluated. The choice
    of "horizon_scale" depends on the specific requirements and objectives of the risk assessment. When the
    "sampling_hours" is set to 1, the "horizon_scale" is expressed in hours. For example, if you set "horizon_scale"
    to 24 hours, it means that the risk analysis will project or estimate the potential risks and their magnitudes
    over a 24-hour timeframe, i.e. of one day.
    While, in theory, the "horizon_scale" can be set to any value, it is recommended to keep it as low as possible
    and not to exceed the 48 hours. The reason for this is that the accuracy of the risk assessment decreases as the
    "horizon_scale" increases. This is because the risk assessment is based on historical data, and the further
    back in time you go, the less relevant the data becomes.

    ### The measures parameter

    The term "measures" refers to the list of risk measures parameters. It represents the list of distribution
    measures that are computed for the given portfolio. The list of possible distribution measures is specified in
    the "MeasureType" enumeration. Note that the concentracion measures require the "confidence_level" parameter,
    while the dispersion measures do not.
    When the measure parameter is empty in the request, a list of reasonable default measures is used. The default
    measures are: StDev, VaR, CVaR, GaR, and CGar with a confidence level of 99%.
    Also note that when the "measures" list contains duplicate tags, only the first occurrence of the tag is used.
