    def get_k_largest_nodes(self, k:int, keep_ancestors:bool=False) -> list[PathNode]:
        """ Return the k nodes with larger size.

        By default, the list contains the nodes that have the largest size but
        in case two nodes in the same lineage belong to the top-k list, the
        ancestor is removed from the list. Still, all the ancestors of each node
        can be easily computed.

        Keeping only the last nodes in the hierarchy allows to go deeper in the
        tree and highlight the large nodes, ignoring (typically) less
        meaningfull ancestors.

        Parameters:
            k: the number of largest nodes requested.
            keep_ancestors: if true, return exactly the k largest nodes, if
            false, return the k largest nodes, taking at max one node for
            each lineage.
