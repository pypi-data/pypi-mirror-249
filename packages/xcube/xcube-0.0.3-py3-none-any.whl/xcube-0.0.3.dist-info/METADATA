## Acknowledgement

This repository is my attempt to create Extreme Multi-Label Text
Classifiers using Language Model Fine-Tuning as proposed by [Jeremy
Howard](https://jeremy.fast.ai) and [Sebastian
Ruder](https://www.ruder.io) in
[ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146v5.pdf). I am also heavily
influenced by the [fast.ai’s](https://fast.ai) course [Practical Deep
Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) and the excellent library
[fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). I have adopted the style of
coding from [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) using the jupyter
based dev environment [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). Since this is one
of my fast attempt to create a full fledged python library, I have at
times replicated implementations from fastai with some modifications. A
big thanks to Jeremy and his team from [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) for
everything they have been doing to make AI accessible to everyone.
