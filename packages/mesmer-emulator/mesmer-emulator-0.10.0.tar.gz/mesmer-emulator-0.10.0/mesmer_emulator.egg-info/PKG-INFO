MESMER: spatially resolved Earth System Model emulations
--------------------------------------------------------
**MESMER** is a **M**\ odular **E**\ arth **S**\ ystem **M**\ odel **E**\ mulator with
spatially **R**\ esolved output, which stochastically creates Earth System
Model-specific spatio-temporally correlated climate variable field realizations at a
negligible computational cost.

In combination with a global mean temperature emulator, MESMER can account for all three
major sources of climate change projection uncertainty at the local scale: (i) internal
variability uncertainty, i.e., unforced natural climate variability; (ii) forced climate
response uncertainty, i.e., the Earth’s system response to forced natural changes (solar
and volcanic) and human influences (greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, land use
changes etc.); and (iii) emission uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the emission pathway
humans decide to follow. An interface between MESMER and global mean temperature
emulators can be found at https://github.com/MESMER-group/mesmer-openscmrunner.

MESMER is under active development both scientifically and technically. Future work will
increase its user friendliness and extend its emulation capabilities to include
additional emulation methods and target climate variables.

  temperatures with MESMER: from global mean temperature trajectories to grid-point-level
  realizations on land, Earth Syst. Dynam., 11, 139–159,

If MESMER is used to emulate multiple emission pathways and/or in combination with a
global mean emulator, the following publication should additionally be cited:
