# Welcome, Overlords!

Welcome your new *function name* overlords by using this module.

This module introduces the `@Overlord` (not overload with an 'a'!)
annotation. It only welcomes your new overloards and then returns
the function/class/object it has been applied to.

This module is not only funny because of the associations with the
OOP concept of overloading and the famous The Simpsons meme, but
can also be considered essential for basically any project, as
this annotation can be quite useful for certain debugging
situations.
