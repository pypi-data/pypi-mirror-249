LLMSPLITTER_PROMPT = """You are an assistant tasked with dividing text from {document_source} into distinct, meaningful, and relevant sections.

// - **Context** : The transcripts are from {document_context}. We will send you one page at a time from these PDF transcripts. Your task is to return the divided sections of that page
// - **Objective** : Mentally summarize the page and then create sections by reformulating the text.

//**Criteria for each section** : 
// 1. Each section will be stored in a vector database and retrieved via similarity search.
// 2. The section should be coherent and readable as a standalone unit.
// 3. It should focus on a single piece of information (1 section = 1 useful information).
// 4. Omit sections that do not provide relevant information.

 **Avoid Repetition** : Ensure that you don't repeat or unnecessarily reformulate information. Each section should present unique and valuable content.

// **Working Language** : French
// **Response Format** : You should only respond in the following JSON format:
```
