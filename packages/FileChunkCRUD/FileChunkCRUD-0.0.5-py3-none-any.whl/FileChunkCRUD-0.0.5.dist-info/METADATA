# FileChunkCRUD

`FileChunkCRUD` is a Python tool designed for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on files, especially large files that need to be processed in chunks to fit into memory constraints.

## Installation

To install `FileChunkCRUD`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install FileChunkCRUD
```

## Usage

### As a Python Module

`FileChunkCRUD` can be used as a Python module in your scripts for handling large file operations.

#### Reading File in Chunks

```python
from filechunkcrud import FileHandler

file_path = '/path/to/your/largefile.txt'
file_handler = FileHandler(file_path)

for chunk in file_handler.read_chunks(chunk_size=1024):  # chunk_size in bytes
    print(chunk)  # or process the chunk
```

#### Creating a Large File with Generator

```python
def large_file_generator(size):
    for i in range(size):
        yield f"This is line {i} of the large file.\n"

file_handler.create_file(large_file_generator(1000000))  # For example, one million lines
```

#### Appending Data to an Existing File with Generator

```python
def additional_data_generator():
    yield "\nMore data...\n"

file_handler.update_file(additional_data_generator())
```

#### Deleting a File

```python
file_handler.delete_file()  # Deletes the file at file_path
```

## Features

- **Read**: Read large files in manageable chunks.
- **Create**: Create new files with content provided by a generator, ideal for large data sets.
- **Update**: Append to existing files using a generator for the content.
- **Delete**: Remove files from the filesystem.
