- Fix linter issues (hatch fmt)
- Type all functions, classes, everything (properly with typing module)
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
  - Generate Python documentation
  - Generate manpages (click-man)
    Don't add as a dependency (dev-dependency?), create a Makefile to take care of that.
  - Some kind of wiki (kind of like debmake-doc)
    - Link Codeberg wiki tab to web version of docs (Codeberg pages)
