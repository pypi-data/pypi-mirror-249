# TALBOTS PYTHON LIBRARY #

Talbots is a simple Python library for understanding, analyzing, and evaluating the content of text generating systems through research papers published in scientific journals. This will be a useful library to help you quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively develop and publish your own projects with the following features:

1. Allows downloading Bibtex information of research papers through the Crossref, Google Scholar;
2. Allows downloading pdf files of research papers through the Crossref or Sci-hub API;
3. Supports data conversion between .pdf and .txt formats and vice versa;
4. Supports finding the relationships between authors;
5. Detects tortured phrases in each research paper.

### THE MAIN FEATURES ###

Here are some functions that the Talbots library can perform well:

* Download Bibtex information via DOIs or Google Scholar links;
* Download PDF files of research papers via DOIs links using Crossref or Sci-hub APIs;
* Filter information of each research paper by year, author, journal, or citation index;
* Convert between file formats (.pdf to .txt or vice versa);
* Extract text from images of each research paper;
* Search for a word or phrase and its location in each research paper;
* Detect tortured phrases in each research paper;
* List the sources of references in each research paper (Updating);
* Detect plagiarism in each research paper (Updating);
* Investigate the relationship between authors (Updating).

### INSTALLATION GUIDE ###

The source code is currently stored on [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) at:

The binary installer for the latest released version is available on both **Python Package Index (PyPI) and Anaconda**:

* Using PyPI: `pip3 install talbots` for MacOS and `pip install talbots` for Windows
* Using Anaconda: `conda install talbots`

### OPEN-SOURCE ###

To make the Talbots library more and more popular, we provide a basic open source code in the form of an open-source for the development community.
