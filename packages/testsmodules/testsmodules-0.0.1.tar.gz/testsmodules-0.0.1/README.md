1. Allows downloading Bibtex information of research papers through the Crossref, Google Scholar;
2. Allows downloading pdf files of research papers through the Crossref or Sci-hub API;
3. Supports data conversion between .pdf and .txt formats and vice versa;
4. Supports finding the relationships between authors;
5. Detects tortured phrases in each research paper.
