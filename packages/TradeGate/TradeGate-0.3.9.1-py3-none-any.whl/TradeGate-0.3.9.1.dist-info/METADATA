An algorithmic trading library to use as a gateway to different exchanges.

## Documentations and examples

Documentations are available on [read the docs](https://tradegate.readthedocs.io), but currently it's not complete.
Examples for each exchange will be added soon, until then, there are good examples in the Test folder.

## How to install

Use this Github repository by running ```python setup.py install```, or using pip:

```bash
pip install TradeGate
```

## How to use

Use with a config file in JSON format. Your config file should look like this:

```json
{
  "Binance": {
    "exchangeName": "Binance",
    "credentials": {
      "main": {
        "futures": {
          "key": "API-KEY",
          "secret": "API-SECRET"
        },
        "spot": {
          "key": "API-KEY",
          "secret": "API-SECRET"
        }
      },
      "test": {
        "futures": {
          "key": "API-KEY",
          "secret": "API-SECRET"
        },
        "spot": {
          "key": "API-KEY",
          "secret": "API-SECRET"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You should read this config file as JSON and give the desired exchange information to the main class initializer. Use
sandbox argument to connect to the testnets of exchanges (if it exists). This is shown below:

```python
from TradeGate import TradeGate
import json

with open('/path/to/config/file.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

gate = TradeGate(config['Binance'], sandbox=True)

print(gate.get_symbol_ticker_price('BTCUSDT'))
```

## Current Supported Exchanges

- Binance
- ByBit
- KuCoin

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. The
best way to contribute right now is to implement as many exchanges as possible. Make sure all test cases are passing.
