# AgentForge
AgentForge is a low-code framework tailored for the rapid development, testing, and iteration of AI-powered autonomous agents and Cognitive Architectures. Compatible with a range of LLM models — currently supporting OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, and Oobabooga (local) — it offers the flexibility to run different models for different agents based on your specific needs.

Whether you're a newbie looking for a user-friendly entry point or a seasoned developer aiming to build complex cognitive architectures, this framework has you covered.

Our database-agnostic framework is designed for seamless extensibility. While [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) is our go-to database, integration with other databases is straight-forward, making it an ideal playground and solid foundation for various AI projects.

In summary, AgentForge is your beta-testing ground and future-proof hub for crafting intelligent, model-agnostic, and database-flexible autonomous agents.
