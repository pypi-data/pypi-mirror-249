# brainglobe

The BrainGlobe Initiative exists to facilitate the development of interoperable
Python-based tools for computational neuroanatomy.

We have three aims:

- Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs,
  such as [cellfinder](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder) and
  [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender).

- Develop core tools to facilitate others to build interoperable tools in Python, e.g. the
  [BrainGlobe Atlas API](https://github.com/brainglobe/bg-atlasapi).

- Build a community of neuroscientists and developers to share knowledge, build software and engage
  with the scientific, and open-source community (e.g. by organising hackathons).

### [**Funding**](https://brainglobe.info/funders.html#funders) Information

The BrainGlobe project is only possible due to grant funding and the generous support of host institutions, whose information [can be found on this website](https://brainglobe.info/funders.html#funders).

## BrainGlobe tools

This package provides all BrainGlobe tools in one place, requested [through a single command](#installation).

You can read more about the individual tools on the [documentation website](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/index.html).
Currently included packages, and whether they come with the `pip` and `conda-forge` installs are listed below:
|       Package        |  `pip`   | `conda`  | `from brainglobe import` |                               Documentation                               |

## Installation

We recommend users install into a fresh virtual environment using `pip`; since this will resolve all complex dependencies (like `tensorflow`) automatically, across all operating systems and (compatible) Python versions.

### **Recommended**: via `pip`
The `brainglobe` package can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/brainglobe/) into a Python environment by running
```sh
pip install brainglobe
```
This will fetch and install all `brainglobe` packages and tools into your current environment.
Alternatively, you can download the source from [PyPI here](https://pypi.org/project/brainglobe/#files).

### **Alternatives**: via `conda`
We are currently in the process of making BrainGlobe's tools available from `conda-forge` as an alternative to `PyPI`.
However certain tools are currently not available on `conda-forge`, specifically:
- `brainrender` (in progress)
- `morphapi` (in progress)
- `cellfinder` ([see below](#cellfinder-and-conda-forge))

In your desired virtual environment, run
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge brainglobe
```
to install the compatible BrainGlobe tools.
This will install all BrainGlobe tools that are compatible with your platform and which are currently available via `conda-forge`.

#### **`cellfinder` and `conda-forge`**

Choosing to install via `conda` will provide the (source code for the) `cellfinder` tool.
However due to an ongoing issue with `tensorflow`'s availability on `conda-forge`, the install _will not_ provide `tensorflow` itself.
This is because `tensorflow` versions newer than `1.14.0` are not provided via `conda` channels, and `cellfinder-core` (one of the brainglobe tools) requires a version between `2.5.0` and `2.11.1`.
See [this issue on GitHub for more details](https://github.com/conda-forge/cellfinder-core-feedstock/issues/13).
Users that want to run `cellfinder` will need to manually install a compatible version of `tensorflow` into their environment, before running the `conda install` command above.
- Windows users will _have_ to manually install their own version of `tensorflow` if they want to use the `conda-forge` install and the `cellfinder` tools.
- `conda-forge` _may_ be able to resolve the dependencies automatically for Linux and MacOS users, however we do not guarantee this. In such a case, a manual install of `tensorflow` will be required first.

If using the `conda-forge` install; attempting to `import` any of `cellfinder`, `cellfinder-napari`, or `cellfinder-core` in your Python scripts may throw an error if the issues above cannot be resolved on your platform.
Similarly, attempting to use `cellfinder`'s CLI functionality will also raise an error.
