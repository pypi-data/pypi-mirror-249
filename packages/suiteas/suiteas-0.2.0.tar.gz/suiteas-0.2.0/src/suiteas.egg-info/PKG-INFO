# SuiteAs

An opinionated testing suite organizer for pytest.

SuiteAs will automatically generate a skeletonized unit test suite based on the
structure of your project. Then, going forward, it will enforce matching names and folder structure between your testing suite and your project.

## Developer Information

### Package Management

This project uses [`rye`](https://rye-up.com/) to manage dependencies, virtual environments, and the python installation. Run `rye sync` from the project root to install the development environment.

### Hooks with `pre-commit`

This project uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage hooks. After installing the development environment, run `pre-commit install`.

### Signed Commits

This project requires signed commits. Please see [this guide from the VS Code project](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Commit-Signing) for instructions on how to configure this.

### Diagramming

This project uses [`D2Lang`](https://d2lang.com/) to develop and maintain design diagrams.

### Changelog

This project uses [`towncrier`](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) to manage the changelog. Each PR should have at least one associated GitHub issue. Before the PR is merged, a changelog entry  should be created for any issues which are resolved by the PR. The changelog entry files are created in the `doc/changelog_entries` directory, with the filename following the convention `<github id>.<type>.rst` where `<github id>` is the GitHub issue ID number, and `<type>` is one of the types documented in the `pyproject.toml` file in the `[tool.towncrier.type]` sections.
