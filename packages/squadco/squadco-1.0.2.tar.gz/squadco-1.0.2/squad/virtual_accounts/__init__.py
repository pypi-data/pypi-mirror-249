    Squad Virtual Accounts API allows you to create and reserve bank account numbers for receiving payments from your customers.\n
    Please note that there is a new compliance rule put in place to mitigate against fraud. As a result, all virtual accounts must carry a slug as a prefix to the name.\n The slug must be a portion of your business name or abbreviations of your business name as one word. Please note that slash (/) is not allowed and only hyphen can be used.\n
    Please be informed that all accounts without the prefix will be flagged by our compliance and fraud team and might ultimately be closed.
