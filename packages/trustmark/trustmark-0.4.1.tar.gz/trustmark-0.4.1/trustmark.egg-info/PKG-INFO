### Quick start and example

Run `pip install trustmark to install the TrustMark package

The following example in Python shows typical usage:
```python
from trustmark import TrustMark
from PIL import Image

# initialize TrustMark 
tm=TrustMark(verbose=True, model_type='C')

# encoding example
cover = Image.open('ufo_240.jpg').convert('RGB')
tm.encode(cover, 'mysecret').save('ufo_240_C.png')

# decoding example
cover = Image.open('ufo_240_C.png').convert('RGB')
wm_secret, wm_present = tm.decode(cover)
if wm_present:
  print(f'Extracted secret: {wm_secret}')
else:
  print('No watermark detected')

# removal example
stego = Image.open('ufo_240_C.png').convert('RGB')
im_recover = tm.remove_watermark(stego)
im_recover.save('recovered.png')
```

### Repository

Refer to the [Github repo](https://github.com/adobe/trustmark) where further examples of use are also available.

Note that models are lazy loaded upon first use from CAI asset repo
