# Raytrace

Py-Raytrace is a simple ray tracing application that creates realistic images by simulating the behavior of light rays in a virtual scene.

## Installation

You can install Raytrace using `pip`:

```bash
pip install py-raytrace
Usage
After installation, you can run Py-Raytrace from the command line:
```
```bash
ray
```

or

```bash
raytrace
```

or
```bash
py-raytrace
``` 

This command will launch the ray tracing process and generate a rendered image based on the provided scene and camera parameters.

## Configuration

Raytrace allows you to configure the scene and camera parameters in the raytrace.py script. You can customize the positions and properties of spheres, lighting, and the floor to create different scenes.

Additionally, the script provides a graphical interface using matplotlib with sliders to adjust the camera angles interactively.

## Dependencies

Py-Raytrace depends on the following Python packages:

```bash
numpy
Pillow (PIL)
tqdm
matplotlib
```
These dependencies will be automatically installed when you install Py-Raytrace using pip.
