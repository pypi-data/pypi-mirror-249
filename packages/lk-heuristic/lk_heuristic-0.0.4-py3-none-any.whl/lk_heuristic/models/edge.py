class Edge:

    The edge class represent an edge in space. The edge is a connection between two nodes. The connection is symmetric, i.e, Edge(AB) == Edge(BA). This symmetric property is implemented in initialization method.

        Initialize an edge with its nodes. The node order (n1/n2) is switched based on node values to guarantee the symmetric property of TSP edges, i.e, {n1,n2} == {n2,n1}. By comparing the nodes, the order will always be the same, so is not necessary to check node ordering later.
