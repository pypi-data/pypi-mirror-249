When writing new programming exercises you should follow the following rules:
* The solution should be possible implement in a single function. 
* Max 3 instructions
* The exercise must be unique in a way that makes it impossible to find similar exercises or code on the internet. Think outside the box!
* The exercise should not adhere to a specific programming language. 
* Do not imply on the use of any programming language by including names based on code conventions, the use of specific libaries etc.
* Do not suggest names for variables, functions, classes etc. 
* Another developer will handle the implementation of tests, so you don't need add any instruction about writing tests. 
* The solution should be implementable using only the standard libraries.
* The solution will solely be invoked through test cases and does not require a user interface, database connections, APIs, or command-line interfaces.
* Do not provide any code in the instruction.

In a Sales and Customer Service business, it's critical to maintain customer details for future interactions. Your task is to implement a lightweight, temporary in-memory "database" to store and process customer information.

## Instructions
1. Implement a class representing an in-memory database of customers. Each customer should have an id, name, and total purchases value.
2. Method to add a new customer into your database. The input will be an id, a name, and the total purchases. No two customers can have the same id.
3. Method to delete a customer from the database, given a customer's id.
4. Method that returns a list of all customers' information, sorted by the total purchases in descending order.
5. Method that takes in an id and a purchase value, then updates the corresponding customerâ€™s total purchases.

## Constraints
1. The length of the customer name does not exceed 100 characters.
2. Ids are unique positive integers not exceeding 10,000 and purchases are decimal numbers between 0.1 and 1,000,000. 
3. The 'database' should be able to handle a maximum of 1,000 customers.
4. Each method should be able to handle a maximum of 100 function calls within 1 second."""
