It provides a straightforward and and intuitive interface to estimate parameters for various types of distributions, both continuous and discrete. Using **fitter**, you can easily fit a range of distributions to your data and compare their fit, aiding in the selection of the most suitable distribution. The package is designed to be user-friendly and requires minimal setup, making it a useful tool for data scientists and statisticians working with probability distributions.\n\nInstallation\n###################\n\n::\n\n    pip install fitter\n\n**fitter** is also available on **conda** (bioconda channel)::\n\n     conda install fitter\n\n\nUsage\n##################\n\nstandalone\n===========\n\nA standalone application (very simple) is also provided and works with input CSV\nfiles::\n\n    fitter fitdist data.csv --column-number 1 --distributions gamma,normal\n\nIt creates a file called fitter.png and a log fitter.log\n\nFrom Python shell\n==================\n\nFirst, let us create a data samples with N = 10,000 points from a gamma distribution::\n\n    from scipy import stats\n    data = stats.gamma.rvs(2, loc=1.5, scale=2, size=10000)\n\n.. note:: the fitting is slow so keep the size value to reasonable value.\n\nNow, without any knowledge about the distribution or its parameter, what is the distribution that fits the data best ? Scipy has 80 distributions and the **Fitter** class will scan all of them, call the fit function for you, ignoring those that fail or run forever and finally give you a summary of the best distributions in the sense of sum of the square errors. The best is to give an example::\n\n\n    from fitter import Fitter\n    f = Fitter(data)\n    f.fit()\n    # may take some time since by default, all distributions are tried\n    # but you call manually provide a smaller set of distributions\n    f.summary()\n\n\n.. image:: http://pythonhosted.org/fitter/_images/index-1.png\n    :target: http://pythonhosted.org/fitter/_images/index-1.png\n\n\nSee the `online <http://fitter.readthedocs.io/>`_ documentation for details.\n\n\nContributors\n=============\n\n\nSetting up and maintaining Fitter has been possible thanks to users and contributors.\nThanks to all:\n\n.. image:: https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=cokelaer/fitter\n    :target: https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/graphs/contributors\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n~~~~~~~~~\n========= ==========================================================================\nVersion   Description\n========= ==========================================================================\n1.7.0     * replace logging with loguru\n          * main application update to add missing --output-image option and use\n            rich_click\n          * replace pkg_resources with importlib\n1.6.0     * for developers: uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.py\n          * Fix progress bar fixing https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/74\n          * Fix BIC formula https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/77\n1.5.2     * PR https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/74 to fix logger\n1.5.1     * fixed regression putting back joblib\n1.5.0     * removed easydev and replaced by tqdm for progress bar\n          * progressbar from tqdm also allows replacement of joblib need\n1.4.1     * Update timeout in docs from 10 to 30 seconds by @mpadge in\n            https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/47\n          * Add Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic by @lahdjirayhan in\n            https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/58\n          * switch branch from master to main\n1.4.0     * get_best function now returns the parameters as a dictionary\n            of parameter names and their values rather than just a list of\n            values (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/23) thanks to\n            contributor @kabirmdasraful\n          * Accepting PR to fix progress bar issue reported in\n            https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/37\n1.3.0     * parallel process implemented https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/25\n            thanks to @arsenyinfo\n1.2.3     * remove vervose arguments in Fitter class.
