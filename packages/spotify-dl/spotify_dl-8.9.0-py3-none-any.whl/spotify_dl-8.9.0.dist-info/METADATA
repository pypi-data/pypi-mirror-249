### Tell me more!

I wanted an easy way to grab the songs present in my library so I can download it & use it offline. I no longer use this, but continue to maintain this. spotify-dl doesn't download anything from Spotify. It picks up the metadata from Spotify API and then uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the song.

### How do I get this thing running?

Install using pip

    pip3 install spotify_dl

Run the program

    spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist_link_1 spotify_playlist_link_2

If you want to make use of parallel download, pass `-mc <number>`, where `<number>` refers to number of cores. If this is too high, spotify-dl will set it to one lesser than max number of cores that you have.

    spotify_dl -mc 4 -l spotify_playlist_link_1 spotify_playlist_link_2

Spotify-dl can make use of SponsorBlock and skip non-music sections when downloading from YouTube. This is disabled by default and can be enabled using:

        spotify_dl -l spotify_playlist_link_1 -s y

For running in verbose mode, append `-V`

    spotify_dl -V -l spotify_playlist_link -o download_directory

For more details and other arguments, issue `-h`

    spotify_dl -h

See [the getting started guide](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) for more details.
