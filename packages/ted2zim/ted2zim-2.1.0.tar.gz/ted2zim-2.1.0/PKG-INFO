An offliner to create ZIM :package: files from TED talks

TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is a global set of conferences under the slogan "ideas worth spreading". They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling. The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can. One can eaisly find all the TED videos [here](https://ted.com/talks).

This project is aimed at creating a sustainable solution to make TED accessible offline by creating ZIM files providing these videos in a similar manner like online.


## Getting started :rocket:

#### Install the dependencies
Make sure that you have `python3`, `unzip`, `ffmpeg`, `wget` and `curl` installed on your system before running the scraper (otherwise you'll get a warning to install them).

#### Setup the package
One can easily install the PyPI version but let's setup the source version. 

First, clone this repository.

If you do not already have it on your system, install hatch to build the software and manage virtual environments (you might be interested by our detailed [Developer Setup](https://github.com/openzim/_python-bootstrap/wiki/Developer-Setup) as well).

```bash
pip3 install hatch
```

Start a hatch shell: this will install software including dependencies in an isolated virtual environment.

```bash
hatch shell
```

That's it. You can now run `ted2zim` from your terminal

```bash
ted2zim --topics [TOPICS] --name [NAME]
```

For the full list of arguments, see [this](ted2zim/entrypoint.py) file or run the following
```bash
ted2zim --help
```

Example usage
```bash
ted2zim --topics="augmented reality" --debug --name="augumented_reality" --format=mp4 --title="Augmented Reality" --description="TED videos in AR category" --creator="TED" --publisher="openzim" --output="output" --keep --low-quality
```

This project can also be run with docker. Use the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) or [pre-build images](https://github.com/orgs/openzim/packages/container/package/ted) to run it with Docker. See steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/).

## Features :robot:
You can create ZIMs for multiple topics (should be same as given [here](https://ted.com/talks)), choose between different video formats (webm/mp4), different compression rates, and even use an S3 based cache.

#### Want more flexibility? There's a multitool
`ted2zim-multi` is an extra command available that allows you to do much more with the scraper. It falls back to `ted2zim` if normal commands are passed. It supports creation of multiple ZIMs with single command for both playlists and topics and even getting metadata from a specified JSON file. It supports the following extra arguments -

- `--indiv-zims` - Allows you to create one zim/topic or one zim/playlist
- `--{name|description|zim-file|title}-format` - Allows you to add custom format for the equivalent `ted2zim` arguments. You can add `{identity}` as a placeholder in these values to get the playlist ID / topic name in it's place (spaces replaced by `-`). You can now also add `{slug}` to get the topic/playlist slug.
- `--metadata-from` - Path to a JSON file containing the metadata.

Should be of the following format:

```bash
{
    "<playlist-id/topic-name-with-underscores>": {
        "name": "sample_name_{identity}",
        "description": "Sample description",
        "title": "Custom title",
        "zim-file": "sample.zim",
        "tags": "tag",
        "creator": "Yourself",
        "build-dir": "/custom_build_dir"
    }
}
```

See `ted2zim-multi --help` for details.
