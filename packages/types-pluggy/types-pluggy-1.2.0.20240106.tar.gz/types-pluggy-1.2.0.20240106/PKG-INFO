## Typing stubs for pluggy

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pluggy`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pluggy`.

This version of `types-pluggy` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pluggy==1.2.0`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pluggy. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `pluggy` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 1.3.0. Please uninstall the `types-pluggy`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `1de5830a2703936a96a126248227d5c7db883674` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.342, and
pytype 2023.12.18.
