An instinctive and impulsive energy flows through you this morning,
dear Aries, as the moon continues its journey through your sign.
Unfortunately, you may have trouble getting past stubborn behaviors as
Venus and Uranus face off, making it important that you don't get your
own way by clinging to tradition. A destructive element also comes
into play, and you'll want to avoid reacting hastily when confronted
with chaos or plot twists. Take a moment to acknowledge your basic
needs this evening when Chiron activates, offering healing and calm.
Inspiration strikes as the day comes to a close, and passionate Mars
triggers your solar ninth house.


Daily Food Horoscope

You'll feel uncharacteristically introverted today. Could a broken
heart be behind your blue mood? Doing something nice for yourself
could brighten your spirit. Soothe your soul with a thick piece of
cheesecake, a cup of mocha java and an upbeat movie.

Buying your elderly father a computer is not a complete gift unless

semi. Once you get into the details, you're in trouble.

to do. Take advantage of your winsome wiles!
