https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/aries.html	January 5, 2024	The moon creeps into Scorpio and the sector of your chart that governs transformation, dear Aries, asking you to acknowledge where change can be made. Remember that shifts must start from within when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn this afternoon, considering how new structures can be created within your life and mind. An expansive energy comes into play when Luna faces off with Jupiter, though you should choose your emotional and financial investments wisely. You may feel closed off as midnight nears and the sun clashes with Chiron, but try to be forthcoming about your need for space.	Cold logic might have worked for Spock and Einstein, but today you'll lack the mental energy for such deep thoughts. Even eating prodigious amounts of brain food, such as blueberries, peppermint tea and salmon, won't give you the mental boost you need to figure out the beta functions of quantum chromodynamics, let alone help you remember where you parked your car.	Stay grounded today and concentrate on your floor and its coverings. Polish your hardwoods until they shine and glow with the warmth of wood. Get down and dirty in the corners and edges of your wall-to-wall carpets with your vacuum attachments. Treat your household to a plush, new shag throw rug in a vibrant color to add spice and comfort.	It's back to the old grindstone, even for you. Your owners place their careers above the doghouse every weekday, and that's hard work for you too. Make the most of it, as only you can.	You're thinking big today, and you'll want an equally big canvas to chart your progress. Whether it's a dry-erase board or a huge sheet of butcher paper, create a picture as large as your ideas.	All you want is for the humans to recognize how important you are to them -- and that might take some doing! It's a good day for you to try a little aggressive action to see what you can stir up.	Silent observation will tell you all you need to know right now. Watch what happens.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/taurus.html	January 5, 2024	The moon migrates into Scorpio and the sector of your chart that governs relationships, dear Taurus, bringing more intimacy to treasured bonds. Invest in dynamics that lift you up as afternoon sets in and Luna blows a kiss to Saturn, considering how the company you keep impacts your ability to thrive and feel safe. Whether you're single or in a relationship, remember to commit only to those you can grow alongside, lest you become stifled by stagnancy. Find time for introspection and spiritual practices as midnight nears and the sun square off with Chiron to offer lessons in healing.	Another birthday potluck needn't have the inevitable conclusion, especially if you take healthy precautions. Prepare a plate of shredded turkey, pinto bean burritos and homemade salsa as your contributions. This way you'll have something more interesting to munch on than the veggie platter.	As the glasses raise around the dinner table tonight, you might just make the most beautiful toast ever. And though it may mean more to you than to everyone else, don't feel bad if you get emotional. Undoubtedly, your wise and sentimental words will touch at least one person's soul.	You can howl the hours away, or you can enjoy spending time alone. The only thing you have to get a grip on to make that difference is your own attitude. Think of it as a good personal day.	Something will seem out of whack today, but you may have trouble finding the source of your irritation. The most likely candidates are two people vying for the same conversational niche or social standing.	You really want to go outside and get dirty -- but your friends may have other ideas! You've got great energy, so no matter what, you're content to be where you are. House plants had better watch out, though!	Take your foot off the gas for a while. It's time to experience your journey.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/gemini.html	January 5, 2024	Reflect on what you can remove from your life in order to promote efficiency and wellness, dear Gemini, as the moon enters Scorpio and your solar sixth house. The structures you create this afternoon are more likely to stick when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn, though you'll need to maintain a steadfast disposition. These vibes can also get you recognition when hard work and skills are applied, so be sure to showcase a strong sense of responsibility. Find ways to establish mind/body harmony when Luna faces off with Jupiter, finding ways to stay calm when tasks accumulate.	The strong clarity you'll start the day with will disappear by midday, leaving you groggy and disoriented. This looks like a job for brain food! A handful of blueberries and almonds tossed into a cup of yogurt will restore your cognitive abilities and help you relax in the face of the things that made you lose your focus in the first place.	Do your best to investigate the reasons for your lack of clarity. If your computer isn't working properly, Internet connection is slow or your TV is getting all wonky, check the cables and turn it off and on before you spend money on a service call. The answer could be as simple as a missed payment.	Your owner is the one being held back for a change, but not by you. That would be just too perfect. While you may have a case of schadenfreude, do you best to smother them with only the most empathetic of emotions.	An encounter with a friend of a friend may prove surprising today. You're open to outside influence and hungry for different points of view, so get an email address or phone number and keep in touch.	Why does everything have to be so hard today? If it feels like too much effort, you might just slink away under the bed or somewhere else relatively free of troubles. Things should pick up later!	Today's a good day to dig in deep and hammer out the inner details and machinations.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/cancer.html	January 5, 2024	It's okay to be driven by passions and desire throughout the next two days, dear Cancer, as the moon enters Scorpio and your solar fifth house. Themes around creativity and ego will also come into play, making it a good time to boost your confidence through hobbies and personal projects. Get back on track with any spiritual or recreational practices that have fallen to the wayside when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn this afternoon, emphasizing the importance of structure in expansion. Avoid large crowds later this afternoon when Luna faces off with Jupiter, opting instead to focus on close friendships.	You won't be into any one thing today; you'll want a little bit of everything. So it seems like Chinese dim sum will be a logical lunch choice. You'll gaze in amazement at trolleys loaded with shrimp dumplings, pork buns, sesame balls and egg tarts. So many choices -- it's a good thing you have plenty of time.	Greeting-card commercials may have the power to tug at your heartstrings today, but don't let this persuade you into thinking you're actually feeling sad. Meanwhile, you may rejoice at the good news of a friend, only to feel let down when you return to your own reality. Take things in stride and be wary of extreme emotions today.	Something is at the very periphery of your awareness. Your human is having problems at work or is out of balance in some other way you can't put your paw on just yet. Don't bother waiting for things to be clear. Be your most loving self now.	You may have some problems with friends today. A conflict between your emotional stance and their more removed opinion will exacerbate any issues. Pretend you're an outside observer and coolly argue the case on your behalf.	You just don't feel much like coming out from your hiding spot today -- unless you hear the can opener, that is! If you do decide to get social, you can be sure it's going to be with those you love and trust.	Reevaluating who you want to be should start with appreciating who raised you.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/leo.html	January 5, 2024	Emotions fluctuate as the moon enters moody Scorpio and your solar fourth house, dear Leo, putting you in an intuitive and sensitive place. Be kind to yourself throughout the next two days, taking extra time to rest at home. Opportunities for intimate exchange come into play as afternoon rolls in and Luna aligns with Saturn, though you should only share with those you are most comfortable with. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you've been feeling overburdened professionally or at home when Luna faces off with Jupiter. Take care of your body and spirit tonight when the sun and Chiron square off.	Those dueling voices in your head will really go at it today. One will be insistent on burritos for lunch, complete with sour cream, cheese and guacamole. The other will be loudly resolute on the healthy benefits of a grilled salmon rice bowl with sauteed broccoli and garlic. You'll need to flip a coin for this one.	Put your shoulder to the wheel' is the saying on your t-shirt today -- but not because you need a reminder. You are naturally as busy as a bee and you'd love it if the other members of your household pitched in and made a concerted effort to help you harvest your next garden.	You have no trouble listening to everything your owner has to say, even the unspoken bits. That's because you can tuck your ego aside and focus on someone other than yourself. It's ironic, but give yourself a pat on the back for your efforts.	The challenge you're facing right now is difficult. The good news? The solution is purely rational. It would be much worse if you had to wait for luck to open doors. Be flexible, and you'll figure it out.	You're feeling just a little bit too sure of yourself today, and that could mean anything from a little fall to some profound humiliation in front of all your human friends! The good news is that it doesn't last long.	Don't sacrifice your goals for anyone. Pressure being put on you may be a bad sign.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/virgo.html	January 5, 2024	You'll fluctuate between transparency and secrecy as the moon enters Scorpio, dear Virgo, bringing an elusiveness to your voice. Small talk will be difficult to stomach, though now is a great time to solidify intimate bonds. Choose wisely what you share when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn, especially when it comes to impressing a romantic interest. Just remember that opening up is an important step in every love story, softening up in ways that feel safe. Luck lingers in the air when Jupiter activates later today, though you'll need to speak up and articulate hopes and dreams.	Keep conversations light and breezy today; religion and politics are strictly verboten. But food is a subject everyone can sink their teeth into! Regale them with stories of your homemade smoked salmon chowder and buttermilk biscuits. They'll hunger for more as they hang on to your every word!	When was the last time you had a candlelit dinner for you and your loved one? Prepare a light meal of luscious beet-and-goat cheese salad followed by rich chocolate mousse and a chilled zinfandel dessert wine. Don't neglect the ambiance of a fresh tablecloth, cloth napkins and a centerpiece of fresh-cut flowers and greenery.	The fun is ultimately worth the wait. It's hard work watching the door all day long, but it pays off when your owner walks through it. In fact, the scene has the uncanny ability to wipe out your memory of an otherwise dull day.	It's a good time to reevaluate the way you do things. Changing your personal routine slightly will introduce a welcome newness to your day, and you never know -- it may increase your efficiency as well.	You need to indulge your creative side -- you've got all kinds of ideas that need to be expressed! You might not be able to really tell the humans what's what until you get over the need to complain, though.	If you stay close to your community of friends today, things will be a lot easier.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/libra.html	January 5, 2024	The moon takes its final steps through your sign this morning, dear Libra, forming a sweet connection with Pluto to restore while offering emotional release. You'll feel grounded and grateful when you awaken and the moon enters Scorpio, heightening your senses and ability to connect with the present. Consider how you can use what you already have to get ahead when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn this afternoon, tapping into your efficient and practical sensibilities. Your generous nature shines through when Jupiter activates, though you should be mindful to save your kindness for those who would do the same.	You'll create quiet a buzz today when you heat up your leftover homemade penne with vodka sauce and capicola. People will horde around you, wanting to know what's in it, where you got the recipe, and inevitably, whether they can have a taste. You may want to take your lunch outside today.	You're not sure what it is, but the outside world is making you feel a bit uneasy and out of sorts today. Spend time in the sanctuary of your kitchen where you feel creative and self-assured. Though it's summer, a comforting wintertime treat, such as potato pancakes with homemade applesauce, might help you feel like yourself again.	The sooner you learn to accept some limits, the happier you'll be. A leash is par for the course. If it helps you justify wearing it, imagine all you'd lose if you refused. Your basket and bowl are but two.	If you were getting a preschool report card, it would be filled with glowing words about your emotional intelligence and your empathetic connection with peers. Then again, it might just say: 'Plays well with others.	You're lost in thought for much of the day, but you never really get comfortable. You may be able to relax with your oldest friends -- furry, human or stuffed -- so see if they're amenable to a cuddle.	Ideas will come if you open your mind. Stop looking for what you already know.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/scorpio.html	January 5, 2024	The Libra moon aligns with Pluto early this morning, dear Scorpio, opening the doors to messages through the dream realms. You should feel refreshed and clear-headed as Luna migrates into your sign, sharpening your perspective around what you want and what is most important in life. Find ways to build yourself up when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn this afternoon, and consider bringing more structure to creative pursuits or passion projects. Love grows when Luna and Jupiter align later today, though you may feel overwhelmed if new connections have been moving more quickly than you're used to.	Take things as they come today. Getting into specifics will prevent you from enjoying simple pleasures. Don't even bother asking what's in the hoagie-sized Vietnamese sandwich laid before you at lunch. So what if there's some mayonnaise in it? After biting into the chili peppers you won't even notice.	That amazing new juicer is in your virtual shopping cart, but you've yet to buy it. Today is a great day to say 'yes' or feel confident about saying 'I'll do it.' Let this sentiment carry over into the satisfying feeling of getting things accomplished for you and your home.	Sometimes it takes sheer willpower to get your point across. Communication is at an all-time low for some reason. If you have to resort to old-fashioned whining or drooling, do so.	Suddenly your room just isn't the refuge you've always considered it to be. Maybe your tastes have shifted slightly, or maybe you've been watching too many home-redecoration shows. Either way, you're ready to make a change.	You need to show the humans that you aren't going to put up with nonsense today -- even if it starts to get uncomfortable. You should be able to at least let them know that you need more respect!	You have the ability to separate the good from the bad today -- use it sparingly.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/sagittarius.html	January 5, 2024	Intense dreams may find you as the moon migrates into Scorpio early this morning, dear Archer, activating the sector of your chart that governs the subconscious. Use messages received to find clarity on what you must do to evolve and what you might be required to let go of. You'll find strength this afternoon when Luna aligns with Saturn, though some time spent alone at home can bring you closer to inner peace. Try not to fret over your to-do lists when Jupiter becomes agitated, focusing instead on how you can bring more organization into your daily life.	Proceeding at your usual methodical pace will win the race for you. This way you can take lots of time perusing the menu at a Chinese restaurant -- so many choices. You'll eventually see something you like in Column A, and then sit back and watch the chow fun begin.	Only you could get away with a kitchen stocked with pink utensils, and your flair for scarves, jewelry and shoes leaves others wondering why you haven't pursued costume design. Your extremely original state of mind allows you to express yourself in all your stunning originality today. Others will yearn for a sip from your cup.	You can't put your paw on just what makes one spot prime and another, well, undesirable. Is it the view? The material? The neighbors? Whatever it is, don't bother shopping around for anything better than the turf you already have.	You have an appetite for new ideas. Fish out that worn piece of paper you used to write down a book someone recommended to you. It's a perfect day to go to the library or bookstore and track it down.	You're going about your business in your own way, just as usual, but your kitty and human friends are still amazed! It may feel a bit weird to you, but it's all just part of the craziness of your normal life.	If something's been bugging you, today is the day to finally do something about it!
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/capricorn.html	January 5, 2024	The moon migrates into Scorpio and the sector of your chart that governs social consciousness, dear Capricorn, making you more sensitive to the news and the state of our world. Consider how you can make a difference by learning about causes that are important to you when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn this afternoon, researching how you can make a positive impact that involves more than standing on your soapbox online. Your confidence grows when Jupiter activates, though you should be wary of anyone who demands too much of your attention. Embrace healing by laying low at home when the sun and Chiron clash.	You'll flirt shamelessly with the opposite sex today -- and perhaps some of the same sex as well. But your efforts will be for naught as they've seen this act before. Save your sweet talk for the candy shop, and buy the gang a big bag of jawbreakers, licorice sticks and chocolate coins if you really want to show them what a sweetie you are.	Your plans are working out splendidly, better than you could've predicted yourself. The household may have been wary of your seemingly outlandish color combinations for the redecorating project, but turquoise and dark brown really look sharp.	You'll finally get the incentive you need to be a good dog, even when you're all by yourself. A bit of recognition from your owner at the end of the day goes a long way.	A natural wariness of suspicious-sounding proposals creeps over you today. Whether they're as serious as a pyramid scheme or as harmless as a chain letter, you doubt claims that others are quick to believe.	You can plan a bank heist, you're so smart -- even without opposable thumbs! You may want to go for something a little closer to legal, just so you don't get your human pals in any trouble.	Maturity beckons you today when you feel an urge to take on more responsibility.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/aquarius.html	January 5, 2024	Don't mess around when it comes to reaching for success, dear Aquarius, as the moon enters intense Scorpio and your solar tenth house. Advocate for what you've earned, especially when Luna blows a kiss to Saturn this afternoon. These vibes also pair well with a little bit of personal pampering, especially if you've been working too hard recently. Consider heading home for work early if you can swing it, as Jupiter brings warmth and joy to your space. Strive to maintain a positive outlook when the sun and Chiron square off, moving away from those with a negative streak.	You'll be quite the giver today. But finding someone with whom to share your dried shredded squid snacks could be hard, probably because they stink to high heaven. They may be popular in Hong Kong, but your less adventurous friends would prefer you kept your snacks a little closer to home.	You can't stop yawning even though you slept eight hours. You're dreaming of comforters, fluffy down, satiny sheets and pillows all day long. Take time out from the pressures of the day to purchase a body pillow, duvet cover or -- better yet -- investigate patterns for making your own.	You may not be sure why you're shown the crate or led into the laundry room. If Monday morning means nothing to you, then you'll have the pattern figured out before too long. For now, don't fight it.	You'll bounce out of bed and scamper to the breakfast table with a spring in your step. Everywhere you go, people will gaze at you with admiration. Use this personal attention to express opinions and gain influence.	You're running into little problems around the house -- ones that you might not have seen coming! Maybe the humans installed a new gate somewhere, but one way or another, you can deal with it.	Things are starting to slow down, so enjoy the rest and conserve all your energy.
https://www.astrology.com/horoscope/daily/pisces.html	January 5, 2024	You'll be all spirit as the moon migrates into Scorpio, dearest Pisces, activating the sector of your chart that governs joy and higher thinking. Use this energy to see beyond yourself, but consider how you might improve your own circumstances when Luna aligns with Saturn this afternoon. You'll crave invigorating conversation when Luna opposes Jupiter later today, though a good book or personal research will be equally alluring. Just make sure you're engaging the mind, lest you become anxious or overwhelmed. Unplug tonight when the sun and Chiron square off, finding healing in your surroundings instead of the digital realms.	You'd join friends for a Chinese lunch today except for three minor details: M, S and G. So eat your ham and bologna sandwich in the loneliness of your cubicle. It'll give you time to contemplate that there is even more sodium in the deli meat than in a plate of sweet and sour pork, making you the loser is this deal.	It may be the first or the 10th time you've attempted one of many fancy sauces, but with the price of these ingredients, you just can't afford to dump this one down the drain. Call your expert friend for advice, whatever the dilemma, and don't risk losing the sauce in favor of saving your pride.	There are still ways to be of assistance to your humans, even when they aren't home. Just remembering not to chew and ignoring the trash would be a big help. Start small and work from there.	You're in a dreamy mood today, and you'll find yourself thinking associatively instead of logically. Write poetry or compose music. One thought will lead to another, and each will be slightly different but on the same theme.	You've got all the right friends -- and on a day like today, you can really use them! It's a good time for you to see if you can get them to help you out in some new ways, so start begging!	You can make a difference today. Add your voice to others' and you'll understand.
