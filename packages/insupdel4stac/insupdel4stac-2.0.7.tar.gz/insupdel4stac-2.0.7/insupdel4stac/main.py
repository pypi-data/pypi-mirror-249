    The current class serves as the primary implementation for performing Insert,

            The default value is set to `os.getcwd()`.
        action (string, optional): The type of action. The selection will be made from
            the options of `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete`. The default setting is set

                "item-id": "item-i*",
            },

        **table (str)**:
            The table name can be one of the following options: `collection` or `item`.

        **collection-id (list, str)**:
            The collection identifier, denoted as `collection-id`, might consist of either a
            Optional(list, str) of collection ids or a partial representation of the collection ids,
            where the remaining portion is indicated by an asterisk (*). Similar to the aforementioned
            illustration.

        **item-id (list, str)**:
            The item identifier (item-id) can consist of either a Optional(list, str) of item identifiers or a truncated
            representation of the item identifiers, with the remaining portion being denoted by an asterisk (*).
            Similar to the aforementioned illustration. However, by selecting the appropriate collection-id while
            dealing with a `item` table, it is possible to enhance the action speed and improve the accuracy of
            the operation. Alternatively, the algorithm searches for the determined `item-id` within all existing
            collections, resulting in a longer than average processing time.
