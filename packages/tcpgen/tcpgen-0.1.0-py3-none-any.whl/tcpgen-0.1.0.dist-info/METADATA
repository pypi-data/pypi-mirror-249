# TCP Traffic Generator

A simple Python script with no dependencies for generating quick TCP traffic to test a port on an endpoint.

# Prerequisites

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
- Ensure Python is in your `PATH`. In Windows, this option may need to be selected during the installation process.
- In Windows, ensure that `.py` files are associated with Python. This option may need to be selected during the installation process.

# Installation

## From PyPI

It is recommended to use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) for user-installed non-system Python applications:

```
pipx install tcpgen
```

If you want to install the program globally (not recommended), you can simply use `pip`:

```
pip install tcpgen
```

## Manual Install

To install the script manually from Github, follow these instructions:

### Windows

- Create the `%USERPROFILE%\.local\` and `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\` directories
- Add `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` to your `PATH` and `.PY` to your `PATHTEXT`
  - Open `File Explorer` > Right click `This PC` > Click `Properties` > Click `Advanced System Settings` > Click `Environment Variables`
  - Select `Path` for your user (not your system), click `Edit`, and add `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`
  - Select `PATHTEXT` for your system, click `Edit`, and add `.PY` to the end of the list
- Move the `tcpgen/main.py` file to the `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\` directory and rename it to `tcpgen.py`
- Add the `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang to the top of `tcpgen.py` file
- Open a new CMD instance and run `tcpgen`

### Linux/MacOS

- Move the `tcpgen/main.py` file to `~/.local/bin/` with the name `tcpgen` (extension not necessary)
- Some distros use the `python` command, and others use `python3`. Add the `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang to the top of the `tcpgen` file. If it doesn't work, change it to `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- `chmod u+x ~/.local/bin/tcpgen` to make the file executable.
- Open a new terminal session and run `tcpgen`

**Note**: The `requirements.txt` file contains dev dependencies only. You do not need to `pip install` the requirements.

# Usage

## No CLI Args

You can use the script without any arguments passed. For example, if using Windows, you might do this:

```
>tcpgen
Hostname/IP: localhost
Resolved localhost to 127.0.0.1
Ports (separated by space, e.g. 22 80 443): 22 80 443 3389
[output omitted]
Hostname/IP:
Exiting...

>
```

This will prompt you for a host and a list of ports until Ctrl-C is detected.

## One CLI Arg

If there is only one argument, the script expects a hostname or IP address. For example:

```
>tcpgen localhost
Resolved localhost to 127.0.0.1
[output omitted]

>
```

By default, port 22 will be used. If you installed manually, you can change this by setting the `DEFAULT_PORTS` variable. For example:

```
DEFAULT_PORTS = [22, 80, 443]
```

## More Than One CLI Arg

If there are multiple arguments, the first must be the hostname or IP address. The rest are expected to be ports. For example:

```
>tcpgen localhost 22 80 443 3389
Resolved localhost to 127.0.0.1
[output omitted]

>
```

# Example

Here's what it looks like:

![Windows](https://github.com/WillChamness/tcpgen/blob/main/.github/windows_example.png?raw=True)

![Ubuntu](https://github.com/WillChamness/tcpgen/blob/main/.github/ubuntu_example.png?raw=True)

Note that the error messages in Windows are different than Linux. In Windows, if the traffic reaches the destination but the traffic is rejected, the traffic will appear to be timed out or dropped (even with Defender Firewall turned off). Ubuntu, however, more accurately displays the error message "Connection refused". This is not a bug, but rather a difference in how the operating systems display rejected traffic. This isn't to say that Ubuntu's error messages are necessarily better, however.
