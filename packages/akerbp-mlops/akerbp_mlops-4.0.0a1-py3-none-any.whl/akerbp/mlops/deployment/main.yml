#  Deployment Pipeline - Version MLOPS_VERSION
#
# We use the following branching and deployment strategy
# 1) For all new commits to PRs from feature branches into develop, we deploy to dev
# 2) Mergin the feature branch into development branch will trigger a deployment to test
# 3) Merging the development branch into master will trigger a deployment to prod
