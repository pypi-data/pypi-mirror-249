           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Nyaml to nxdl

A tool to convert yaml NeXus application definitions (nyaml) to nexus definitions language (nxdl) and vice versa.

This tool is a simple command line interface and can be used by calling `nyaml2nxdl` or its shortcut `n2n`:

```console
user@box:~$ nyaml2nxdl --help
Usage: nyaml2nxdl [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE

  Main function that distinguishes the input file format and launches the
  tools.

Options:
  --output-file TEXT   The output file path to write the converted file to
  --check-consistency  Check if yaml and nxdl can be converted from one to
                       another version recursively and get the same version of
                       file. E.g. from NXexample.nxdl.xml to
                       NXexample_consistency.nxdl.xml.
  --do-not-store-nxdl  Whether the input nxdl file will be stored as a comment
                       at the end of output yaml file.
  --verbose            Print in standard output keywords and value types to
                       help possible issues in yaml files
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

**How the tool works**:
1. Reads the user-specified NeXus instance, either in yaml or xml format.
2. If input is in yaml, creates an instantiated nxdl schema xml tree by walking the dictionary nest.
   If input is in xml, creates a yaml file walking the dictionary nest.
3. Write the tree into a yaml file or a properly formatted nxdl file to disk.
4. Optionally, if --append argument is given,
   the XML or yaml input file is interpreted as an extension of a base class and the entries contained in it
   are appended below a standard NeXus base class.
   You need to specify both your input file (with yaml or xml extension) and NeXus class (with no extension).
   Both .yaml and .nxdl.xml file of the extended class are printed.


## How to install

The tool can be easily installed via pip

```
pip install nyaml
```

or as a development install from this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nyaml.git
cd nyaml
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

There is also a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) available which formats the code and checks the
linting before actually commiting.
It can be installed with
```shell
pre-commit install
```
from the root of this repository.

## Documentation

**Rule set**: From transcoding YAML files we need to follow several rules.
* Named NeXus groups, which are instances of NeXus classes especially base or contributed classes. Creating (NXbeam) is a simple example of a request to define a group named according to NeXus default rules. mybeam1(NXbeam) or mybeam2(NXbeam) are examples how to create multiple named instances at the same hierarchy level.
* Members of groups so-called fields or attributes. A simple example of a member is voltage. Here the datatype is implied automatically as the default NeXus NX_CHAR type.  By contrast, voltage(NX_FLOAT) can be used to instantiate a member of class which should be of NeXus type NX_FLOAT.
* And attributes of either groups or fields. The mark '\@' have to precede the name of attributes.
* Optionality: For all fields, groups and attributes in `application definitions` are `required` by default, except anything (`recommended` or `optional`) mentioned.

**Special keywords**: Several keywords can be used as children of groups, fields, and attributes to specify the members of these. Groups, fields and attributes are nodes of the XML tree.
* **doc**:
   - A human-readable description/docstring
   - Doc string may also come as a list of doc parts when user wants to add `reference` for a concept. Or doc string could be a single doc block.
      ```yaml
         energy:  # field
            doc:
               - |
                 Part1 of the entire doc.
                 part1 of the entire doc.
               - |  # Reference for concept
                 xref:
                   spec: <spec>
                   term: <term>
                   url: <url>"
               - |
                 Rest of the doc
                 rest of the doc
         velocity:  # field
            doc: |
               A single block of doc string.
      ```
      Such structure of doc would appear in `nxdl` as
      ```xml
      ...
      <field name="energy">
        <doc>
            Part1 of the entire doc.
            part1 of the entire doc.

                This concept is related to term `&lt;term&gt;`_ of the &lt;spec&gt; standard.
            .. _&lt;term&gt;: &lt;url&gt;

            Rest of the doc
            rest of the doc
        </doc>
      </field>
      <field name="velocity">
        <doc>
            A single block of doc string.
        </doc>
      </field>
      ```



* **exists** Options are recommended, required, [min, 1, max, `infty`] numbers like here 1 can be replaced by any `uint` (unsigned integer), or `infty` to indicate no restriction on how frequently the entry can occur inside the NXDL schema at the same hierarchy level.
* **link** Define links between nodes.
* **units** A statement introducing NeXus-compliant NXDL units arguments, like NX_VOLTAGE
* **dimensions** Details which dimensional arrays to expect
* **dim** Shorthand notation for dimensions, e.g., `(n, )` for an 1D array of length `n` or `(n, m)` for an 2D array of size `n x m`.
* **enumeration** Python list of strings which are considered as recommended entries to choose from.
* **dim_parameters** `dim` which is a child of `dimension` and the `dim` might have several attributes `ref`,
`incr` including `index` and `value`. So while writing `yaml` file schema definition please following structure:
```yaml
dimensions:
   rank: integer value
   dim: [[ind_1, val_1], [ind_2, val_2], ...]
   dim_parameters:
      ref: [ref_value_1, ref_value_2, ...]
      incr: [incr_value_1, incr_value_2, ...]
```
Keep in mind that length of all the lists must have the **same size**.
**Important Note**: The attributes `ref`, `incr`, `index` are deprecated.

## Project roadmap

The NOMAD team is currently working to establish a one-to-one mapping between NeXus definitions and the NOMAD MetaInfo(scientific data model in nomad). As soon as this is in place the YAML files will be annotated with further metadata so that they can serve two purposes. On the one hand they can serve as an instance for a schema to create a GUI representation of a NOMAD Oasis ELN schema. On the other hand the YAML to NXDL converter will skip all those pieces of information which are irrelevant from a NeXus perspective.
