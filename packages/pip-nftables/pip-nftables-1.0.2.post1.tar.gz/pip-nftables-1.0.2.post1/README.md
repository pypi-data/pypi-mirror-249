# NFTables 

This is a copy of the python3-nftables module that is used to interact with [libnftables](https://www.mankier.com/5/libnftables-json).

The repository is used to serve it using PyPI

The goal of this repo is to keep up to date with changes in the main repo and serve it in PyPI. This is highly based in [ansibleguy idea](https://github.com/ansibleguy/python3-nftables) and repo, with some automation
