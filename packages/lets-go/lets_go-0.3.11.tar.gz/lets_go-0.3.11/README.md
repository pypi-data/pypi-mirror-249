## Planning
By now, there is only basic rules supporting for the **Go** game, and hasn't any new plans for the next step. No **AI**, no **GTP**, no **kifu**, just simple playing for fun.

I wrote the game only for an idea of verifing **ltermio** package, maybe there will be new ideas based on personal inspiration, or maybe that's it.

## Experience
Alrough I added **VI** like keys supporting for cursor moving, the experience of the game based on keyboard is still not good.  
**ltermio** has supported mouse after version 0.4.6, lets-go followed up and indeed makes experience better, but mouse pointer shape is a bit of trouble.
