## Background
I wrote this game when I was learning **Python** language a few months ago. As a learning practice, it's not about business, but just for fun and to reminisce about the past.

The game package dependent on my another Python package **ltermio**, no other third-party packages required. In fact, the **ltermio** is its by-product.

I also wrote an AI engine **tzero** for the game, with **C++** language and **ctypes** library, but it consumes too much computing power and doesn't run very well, so I termporarily removed this part of code from the package.
