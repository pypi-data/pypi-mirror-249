    Projects are the core representation of the organization of a
    project that can be run with the docker CLI. When a project is
    setup by the Setup class, it can decide to setup the project asy
    nchronousl, e.g by cloning a git repository, or copiying a
    directory into the .dokker directory. The project can also
    implement methods that will be run before and after certain
    docker-compose commands are run. For example, a project can
    implement a method that will be run before the docker-compose
    up command is run.
