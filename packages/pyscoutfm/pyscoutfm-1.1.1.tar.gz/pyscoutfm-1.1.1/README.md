## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Generate scout reports from your squad and scouting screens within FM
- üìä Uses a customisable rating system to score players out of 100
- üîß Tweak or create your own weightings to evaluate players
- üìÇ Exports the scout report into a pretty HTML file
- üî≠ Easily search and sort the players in the scout report

## ‚ö° Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- Football Manager (any version that supports the supplied views)
- Windows/MacOS

## üì¶ Installation

1. Check if you have Python installed by opening up a Command Prompt/Terminal and typing `python -V`
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't.

> **Note**: If you're on Windows, follow [this guide](WINDOWS_INSTALL.md) and if you're on Mac, I suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

3. Once installed, in the Command Prompt/Terminal, run:

```
pip install pyscoutfm
```

4. To verify the installation, run:

```
pyscoutfm -V
```

## üéÆ Generating a Scout Report

Let's get down to business and show you how quickly you can generate a scouting report for your current squad from the command line.

1. Firstly, and for reference, to see a list of the commands and options available to you at any step of the way with PyScoutFM, append `--help` to a [command](#rocket-commands):

```
pyscoutfm generate --help
```

### Export data from FM

The tool requires an extract of data from Football Manager. To make this easy, we can use the _views_ that come supplied with PyScoutFM.

2. To save you hunting for them, run:

```
pyscoutfm copy-views-to --path="MY_LOCATION"
```

> Where `MY_LOCATION` is the path you wish to copy the views to

3. Import the views into FM; we'll start with the main squad screen of the team you're managing but note that you could go into your scouting screen as well:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/olimorris/PyScoutFM/assets/9512444/bf1a1711-6d40-4c93-b77f-06a8aba216dc" alt="importing a view" />
</div>

4. In the squad screen, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> (Mac) to select all of the players in the screen (this can be laggy!), followed by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>/<kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, selecting _Web Page_ as the print format:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/olimorris/PyScoutFM/assets/9512444/1d7c7254-1a41-4aed-ad01-3e825ba0e78b" alt="printing a screen" />
</div>

5. Save the printed file into your chosen location:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/olimorris/PyScoutFM/assets/9512444/87282629-35b7-4fad-a5e0-360eef3d12a3" alt="saving the print file" />
</div>

### Generating the Scout Report

The tool comes with a default [config](src/pyscoutfm/config/config.json) file along with some sensible [attribute weightings](src/pyscoutfm/config/weightings.json) (which were the result of some heavy Machine Learning analysis).

6. In your terminal application run the command:

```
pyscoutfm generate --import-path=MY_LOCATION --export-path=MY_LOCATION
```

Where `MY_LOCATION` is the path from step 5.

> **Note**: The tool is smart enough to only load the most recent _html_ file in the directory you specify

7. You should see a _Success_ message confirming the generation of the report.

### Using the Scout Report

So you have a Scout Report, now what?

8. Open up `latest.html` in your browser and you should see your players from the squad screen alongside their positional ratings which have been calculated with the tool:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/olimorris/PyScoutFM/assets/9512444/d6e1c53c-dfbd-4645-9314-04590d09ef71" alt="The scout
    report" />
</div>

9. Clicking on the arrows next to the column headings allows you to sort by that column. Also, a helpful search box makes it easier to find specific players.

10. Each of the rating columns represents a score out of 100. That is, how well suited a player is to a particular position based on the attribute weightings defined in the default [weightings file](src/pyscoutfm/config/weightings.json)

### Hints and Tips

You may find yourself tweaking your search results in Football Manager and re-generating scouting reports often. Below are some tips for doing this optimally:

1. Players that are not fully scouted will not be rated accurately! If you play with attribute masking and they have an attribute of `-` then the tool will convert it to `1`. Also, if they have an attribute range of `7-11`, the tool will use `7`.

2. Always export your Football Manager data to the same location. The tool is smart enough to be able to load the most recent HTML file in a directory if you don't pass it an `import_path` parameter.

3. You don't need to re-type your command in the Command Prompt/Terminal. Instead use the <kbd>Up</kbd> key to scroll through historical commands.

4. Once the report has been generated, just refresh the webpage in the Browser. The tool will always overwrite the `latest.html`. Don't worry though...it also saves a datetime stamped copy of the report as well.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQs

**Q. Why should I use PyScoutFM over Genie Scout?**

A. I think it comes down to your workflow and how you play the game. I am on a Mac mostly which doesn't help when it comes to using Genie Scout. I also like to use custom weightings which are easier to update with PyScoutFM and I _think_ the ratings that come out this are more accurate than Genie Scout's defaults.

**Q. How does PyScoutFM differ to Squirrel's web app and which is better?**

A. Firstly, huge props to Squirrel for starting this _movement_ with Python and Football Manager. I disagreed with how they've setup their weighting/rating system in their tool and valued the work and analysis that had taken place over on [FM-Arena's](https://fm-arena.com/thread/1949-fm22-positional-filters-what-are-the-best-attributes-for-each-position) site. As such, I think that PyScoutFM produces more accurate outputs...and even if you don't think so, you can very quickly change the [weightings](src/pyscoutfm/config/weightings.json) to your liking.

I've put together a comparison table between the two apps:

| Feature | PyScoutFM | Squirrel's |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Online web application | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Import HTML from Football Manager | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| HTML output | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Number of player roles/positions in the output file | Unlimited | 8 |
| Ratings by role* | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Ratings by position | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Ratings are a score out of... | 100 | 20 |
| Customisable weightings | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Evidence for weightings** | [Here](https://fm-arena.com/find-comment/11228/) | [Here](https://youtu.be/DvV9Aigngi8?t=377) |
| Customisable player positions | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Customisable attribute groupings*** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Customisable columns in the output file | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

\* This isn't in PyScoutFM by default but can be added in manually.

\** For PyScoutFM this is a little convoluted but the work done by [Mark](https://fm-arena.com/profile/912-mark/) to produce a balanced filter for Genie Scout was translated into the [default weightings](src/pyscoutfm/config/weightings.json) file.

\*** I like to create a [club DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-F5qI0fI3A) for my saves and this feature allows me to group and weight particular attributes together to produce a DNA rating.
