# QtMPLtools
QtMPLtools is a package that integrates a set of custom Matplotlib plugins for the python GUI editor Qt designer, aiming to be able to drag and drop plot widgets on a GUI form. This package is based on the PyQt6 library (as opposed to PySide6).

## Launching designer

Since this package operates under PyQt6 and pyqt6-tools, type either of the following to launch designer:
```python
pyqt6-tools designer
```
or
```python
designer
```

## Checking if there was a successful installation
Once designer is launched, you should see 4 types of matplotlib plots under a 'Plots' group:
