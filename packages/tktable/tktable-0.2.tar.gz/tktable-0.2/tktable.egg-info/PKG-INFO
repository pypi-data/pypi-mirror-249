Description: # tktable
        
        **tktable** is a Python library designed to simplify the creation of beautiful tables in Tkinter GUI applications.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Developers using Tkinter often find creating tables natively to be challenging and time-consuming. Importing **ttk.TreeView** and writing numerous lines of unnecessary code is a common frustration. **tktable** offers a solution, allowing you to create attractive tables with just a few lines of code, enhancing the simplicity and ease of Python development.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installing **tktable** is straightforward. Simply execute the following pip command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install tktable
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Using **tktable** is intuitive and requires just a few steps.
        
        ### Step 1
        
        Import the `Table` class from the **tktable** package:
        
        ```python
        from tktable import Table 
        ```
        
        ### Step 2
        
        Create an instance of the `Table` class and provide the necessary arguments:
        
        ```python
        table_headers = ("Name", "Age", "Email")
        mytable = Table(root, table_headers)
        mytable.pack() 
        ```
        
        ### Step 3
        
        Insert rows into the created table:
        
        ```python
        row1 = ("Jack", 12, "jack@gmail.com")
        mytable.insert_row(row1)
        row2 = ("John", 15, "john@gmail.com")
        mytable.insert_row(row2) 
        ```
        
        ## Customization Options
        
        Enhance the appearance of your table by customizing it with optional arguments in the `Table` class constructor.
        
        For example, to make the headers bold:
        
        ```python
        mytable = Table(root, table_headers, headings_bold=True)
        ```
        
        Adjust column width:
        
        ```python
        mytable = Table(root, table_headers, col_width=100)
        ```
        
        Change the font size of the table content:
        
        ```python
        mytable = Table(root, table_headers, font_size=12)
        ```
        
        Modify the font face of the table content:
        
        ```python
        mytable = Table(root, table_headers, font_face="Times New Roman")
        ```
        
        Stay tuned for additional customization options in future releases!
        
        ## Sample Application
        
        ```python
        import tkinter as tk
        from tktable import Table
        
        root = tk.Tk()
        root.geometry("800x400")
        
        table_headers = ("Name", "Age", "Email")
        mytable = Table(root, table_headers, col_width=150, headings_bold=True)
        mytable.pack(pady=100)
        
        row = ("Nitin", 18, "ngarg@mail.com")
        mytable.insert_row(row)
        
        root.mainloop()
        ```
        
        ## Contributions
        
        Currently, the module's source code is not open-source. After publishing 2-3 more releases, we plan to open-source it. Stay tuned for updates!
