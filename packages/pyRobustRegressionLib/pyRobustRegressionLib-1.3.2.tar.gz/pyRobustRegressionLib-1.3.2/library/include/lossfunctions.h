	//returns the error of the fit. It consists of an array with the residual error between every datapoint and the fitted function
	// and the main error, which is the sum of a certain metric, either
	// the square the residuals, 
	// ubers loss function of each residual, 
	// or the absolute value of each residual
	// of the points that were used in the fit.

	//errorfunction_name specifies the name of the metric that determines how the main error is computed.
	// 
	// squaredresidual sets the errorfunction per point to (y[i]-f(X[i]))^2/pointnumber, where pointnumber is the number of points used in the fit.
	// The entire loss is the sum of these errors.
	// Note that we divide by the number of points, otherwise, one would have a reduction of the error if we always reduce the pointsize.
	// 
	// absolutevalue sets the errorfunction per point to |y[i]-f(X[i])|/pointnumber, where pointnumber is the number of points used in the fit. 
	// The entire loss is the sum of these errors.
	// Note that we divide by the number of points, otherwise, one would have a reduction of the error if we always reduce the pointsize.
	// 
	// if Huber's loss function is used, one should set the parameter, called huberslossfunction_border which is called delta
	// in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss . By default, huberslossfunction_border=10 but this is only an arbitrary default value that should be changed.
	// The errorfunction is then given by Huber's loss function/pointnumber,
	// where pointnumber is the number of points fitted.
	// 
	// logcosh is a loss function that sets log(cosh(y[i]-f(X[i]))/pointnumber as size of the error at point (X[i],Y[i]), where f is the function that is fitted
	// and pointnumber is the number of points used in the fit.
	// 
	// if the quantile loss function is used, we need the gamma parameter and set the loss per point 
	// to (gamma-1)* (y[i]-f(X[i])/pointnumber if y[i]-f(X[i]<0 and to gamma*(y[i]-f(X[i])/pointnumber otherwise. f is the function that is fitted and pointnumber
	// is the number of points used in the fit. Note that quantile is an asymmetric loss function. Therefore, it should mostly be used with the linear
	// robust curve fitting algorithms, since then it is only used for outlier removal. If the quantile loss function is used with the non-linear robust algorithms
	// it is likely to confuse the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
	// 
	// if custom is used, the function pointer loss_pp is called as loss_pp(Y[i],f(X[i],pointnumber) which should compute an user defined 
	// loss function of the datapoint (X[i],Y[i]), where f(X[i]) is the predicted values from the fit at X[i], pointnumber is the number of points that are
	// fitted. This is information is included so that the loss function can scale with the pointnumber, if needed.
	// 
	// if custom is used and agg_err is set to null, the entire error between the predicted values f(X) and the data Y for all indices
	// X[i] will be set simply to the sum of the losses per point. 
	// if custom is used and  agg_err is not set to Null, then it is called with a reference to a double valarray that contains the losses per point 
	// as given by calls of loss_pp for all data points. The function agg_err should then compute the value of the total error in return.
	// 
	// Note that if robst regression methods are used, it is best if the aggregate error is some kind of average error. The robust curve fitting methods
	// can remove points based on this quantity. If, e.g the lossperpoint is the square of the errors per point, and agg_err is just their sum, without
	// a division by the number of points, then, if all points do not provide a 100% exact fit, one would reduce the error usually in any case if 
	// one just removes the number of points. This would, however, not increase the precision of the fit, but it would usually imply that not enough points
	// would be used. So it is best to set the aggregate error agg_err to some kind of average, which can be achived e.g. by summing over the given residuals 
	// and then dividing by the pointnumber, i.e. by the size of the given array. or by scaling the value returned of lossperpoint by the pointnumber.
