								"linear regression or Siegel's repeated median algorithm, that have their own error metric which they minimize.\n"
								"In contrast, when a non-linear robust algorithm is used, the loss function is also used for the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. "

								"Note that quantile is an asymmetric loss function.Therefore, it should mostly be used with the linear robust curve fitting "

								"if custom is chosen, then the pointer to a function loss_pp(Y,Y_pred) needs to be initialized with a function that returns a double "

								" and the curve fit f(X[i]) at that point.\n"
								"With custom set, one may also initialize the function pointer aggregate_error with a function aggregate_error(errorarray). "
								"It is called with an array of values generated by calls to loss_pp. aggregate_error should return a double value representing " 
								"the accumulated loss between the data and the curve fit for all datapoints.\n"
								"Usually, it is good to chose some sort of average error for this function.The robust curve fitting "

								"errorarray) is usually a better measure\n"
								"If custom is used and aggregate_error is not initialised, then the entire error is set to the sum of the results of the calls of "
