## Typing stubs for pyjks

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pyjks`](https://github.com/kurtbrose/pyjks) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pyjks`.

This version of `types-pyjks` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pyjks==20.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyjks. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `1de5830a2703936a96a126248227d5c7db883674` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.342, and
pytype 2023.12.18.
