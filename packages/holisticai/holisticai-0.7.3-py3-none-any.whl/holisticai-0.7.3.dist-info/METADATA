The Holistic AI library is an open-source tool to assess and improve the trustworthiness of AI systems.  

Currently, the library offers a set of techniques to easily measure and mitigate Bias across numerous tasks. In the future, it will be extended to include tools for Efficacy, Robustness, Privacy and Explainability as well. This will allow a holistic assessment of AI systems.

# Installation:
For metrics, you can use the default installation:

```bash
pip install holisticai # basic installation
pip install holisticai[bias] # bias mitigation support
pip install holisticai[explainability] # for explainability metrics and plots
pip install holisticai[all] # install all packages for bias and explainability
```
## Troubleshooting
on **macOS** could be necessary some packages before install holisticai library:
```bash
brew install cbc pkg-config
python -m pip install cylp
brew install cmake
```

## Explainability Visualization Tools

Install GraphViz
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```
