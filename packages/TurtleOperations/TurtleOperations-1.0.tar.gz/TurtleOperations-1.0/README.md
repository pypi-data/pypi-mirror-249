# Operations

This Python module provides basic mathematical operations.

## Usage

Import the `operations` module into your Python script as long as it's in the same folder as the main project file.

### Examples:

```python
import operations

# Addition
result_add = operations.add(2, 2, 2)
# Result: 6

# Subtraction
result_subtract = operations.subtract(2, 2, 2)
# Result: -2

# Multiplication
result_multiply = operations.multiply(2, 2, 2)
# Result: 8

# Division
result_divide = operations.divide(2, 2, 2)
# Result: 0.5

# Exponentiation
result_exponent = operations.exponent(2, 3)
# Result: 8
