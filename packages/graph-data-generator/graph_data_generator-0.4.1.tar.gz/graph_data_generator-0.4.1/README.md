# Graph Data Generator
Package for generating interconnected mock data from .json graph data models.

## JSON Spec
Is the same specification used by the [arrows.app](https://arrows.app) which is a GUI for generating graph data models. The .json spec has 2 required keys, `nodes` and `relationships`:
```
{
    "nodes":[],
    "relationships: []
}
```
Each must contain an array (or list) of dictionary objects with formats dependent on the key type:

**Nodes** must have the following property keys and value types:
```
{
    "id": str,
    "position": {
    "x": float,
    "y": float
    },
    "caption": string,
    "labels": list[str],
    "properties": dict[str:str],
    "style": {}
}

Example:
{
    "id": "n0",
    "position": {
    "x": -306.93969052033395,
    "y": 271.3634778613202
    },
    "caption": "Person",
    "labels": [],
    "properties": {
        "email": "test@email.com",
        "salary_usd": "3000.00",
        "first_name": "Jane",
        "last_name": "Doe"
    },
    "style": {}
}
```

**Relationships** must have the following keys and value types:
```
    {
      "id": str,
      "type": str,
      "style": dict,
      "properties": dict[str,str],
      "fromId": str,
      "toId": str
    }

Example:
    {
      "id": "n0",
      "type": "WORKS_AT",
      "style": {},
      "properties": {
        "start_epoch":"1672904355",
        "end_epoch":"1688542755"
      },
      "fromId": "n0",
      "toId": "n1"
    }
```

**Properties** of either nodes or relationships can be used to further define the type of data generated.

The following keywords are reserved:
| Keyword  |  Description  |  Example Value |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| COUNT | Specifies the number of this node or relationship type to generate | 3 |

***COUNT***
The COUNT keyword can take the following optional value formats:

| Type | Example  |  Output Description |
|------| ---------|---------------|
| Int |  2 | Would generate two of the nodes / relationships this was a property for |
| Range | 0-10 | Would randomly generate a number between 0 (No node or relationship) and 10 |
| Random from List | [3,5,6] | Would randomly generate three, five, or six nodes / relationships |

All other node / relationship property keys will be passed along to generated records. Values will be passed along as strings unless they match 1 of several formats:

***GENERATOR SPECIFICATIONS***
Generator specifications are stringified JSON dictionaries that have only a single key that takes a single list as an arg, looking like:
```
{ "generator_name": [] }
```
The `generator_name` must be one of the existing unique generator names included in the package's `generators/` folder. If this format is detected but a matching generator can not be found, then the entire string will be written as the property value.

The list value is the arguments list for the generator. The expected value types and number are dependent on the specified generator. The `generators/ALL_GENERATORS.py` file contains a `generators_json` file that list all the available generators, their type, and what arguments (if any) each expect.

Types of Generators:
| Type | Output Description |
| ------ | ---------|
| bool | True or False |
| int | Integer number |
| float | Float value |
| string | String value |
| datetime | A string representation of an ISO 8601 datetime object |
| assignment | Used to determine how to exhaust a source list. ie relationships generation |
| function | Combines output from multiple generators |


*Function Generators*
Function generators allow combining output from multiple generators. Use other generator specifications in it's argument in the order they should be combined in.

***CONVENIENCE KEYWORDS***
The following keyword values, regardless of casing, will map to pre-built generators as shorthands:
| Value | Output Description  |
| ------ | ---------|
| bool | Random True or False value |
| boolean | (Same as above)
| date | Random date between 1970-01-01 and today |
| datetime | (Same as above) |
| int | Random integer between 1 and 100 |
| integer | (Same as above) |
| float | Random two decimal float value between 1.00 and 100.00 |
| string | Between 1 and 3 random lorem words |

***CONVENIENCE SHORTHANDS***
The following value formats will map to pre-built functions with a given set of arguments:
| Type | Example Value | Output Description  |
| ------ | ---------| ----- |
| Range of Ints | 0-3 | Each record will have a randomly generated value between 0 and 3 |
| Range of Floats | 1.0-3.0 | Each record will have a randomly generated float value between 1.0 and 3.0. The highest decimal precision in either the start or end range value will be returned |
| List of Ints | [1,3,5] | Each record will have a randomly selected int value from the list |
| List of Floats | [2.0, 5.00, 7.001] | Each record will have a randomly selected float from the list. The highest precision specified in any of the floats will be used in the resulting value (so if 2.0 were selected, the value 2.000 would be returned) |
| List of Strings | ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "Spiderman"] | Each record would have one of the listed string values. So from the example case: `Iron Man`, `Captain America`, or `Spiderman` would be assigned to each node / relationship record created |


## Installation
`pip install graph-data-generator`

To use in a project:
`import graph_data_generator as gdg`

To generate a .zip file and return as bytes, pass a json object as an arg:
`bytes_file = gdg.generate_zip(json_object)`

## Package Usage
Build locally:
`poetry build`

To use in another poetry project:
`import graph_data_generator as gdg`
