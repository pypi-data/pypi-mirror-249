# Description: Configuration file for training the model

# --- Model Configurations ---
model_name: resnet18
num_input_channels: 3 # Number of input channels for the model.

# --- Dataset Configurations ---
dataset_name: cifar10
num_classes: 10 # Number of classes in the dataset.
train_dataset_path: null # Path to the train dataset. Required if dataset_type is custom.
test_dataset_path: null # Path to the test dataset. Required if dataset_type is custom.

# --- Training Configurations ---
epochs: 10 # Number of epochs to train for.
batch_size: 32 # Batch size for training. If using ddp, this will be divided equally among all GPUs. Consider having batch_size_per_gpu * num_gpus in case of ddp.
lr: 0.001 # Learning rate for training.
optimizer: adam #
optimizer_kwargs: # Optional arguments for the optimizer. If not provided, default values will be used.
  weight_decay: 0.0001
scheduler: LINEAR_LR # Scheduler to use for training. Options: [CONSTANT_LR, LINEAR_LR, STEP_LR, EXP_LR, COSINE_LR] If not provided, no scheduler will be used.
scheduler_kwargs: null # Optional arguments for the scheduler. If not provided, default values will be used.
loss: cross_entropy

# --- DataLoader Configurations ---
num_workers_train: 4 # Number of workers for the train dataloader.
num_workers_test: 4 # Number of workers for the test dataloader.
shuffle_train: True # Whether to shuffle the train dataloader. If using ddp this should be false.
shuffle_test: false # Whether to shuffle the test dataloader.
drop_last_train: False # Whether to drop the last batch for the train dataloader.
drop_last_test: False # Whether to drop the last batch for the test dataloader.

# Device Configuration
use_ddp: False # Whether to use multi-GPU training with DistributedDataParallel.

# --- Device Configuration SINGLE GPU ONLY ---
# This configuration is only for single GPU training. For multi-GPU training, use the next configuration.
device: CPU # Training device. Options: [CPU, CUDA, MPS] or specific GPU ID [cuda:0, cuda:1, ...]

# --- Device Configuration MULTI GPU ONLY ---
# This configuration is only for multi-GPU training. For single GPU training, use the previous configuration. Make sure to set use_ddp to True.
gpu_ids: null # List of GPU IDs to use for training. If null, uses all available GPUs.
pin_memory: True # Whether to pin memory for the dataloader.

# Model Saving Configurations
