# Description: Configuration file for the Deciison Boundary attack

# Model Configuration
model_name: CustomMnistModel # Name of the model to be attacked
trained_on: mnist # Dataset on which the model was trained.
pretrained: False # Whether the model is pretrained. Defaults to False. This is only applicable if the model is a torchvision model
pretrained_weights: null # Weights for the pretrained models. If null uses the default weights. This is only applicable if the model is a torchvision model
model_weights: null # Path to model weights. If null, uses weights/{model_name}_{trained_on}_weights.pth. You can leave it empty if you have downloaded the weights to the default path
device: CPU # Device for executing attacks. Options: [CPU, CUDA, MPS]

# Attack Dataset Configuration
dataset_name: mnist # Dataset for attack. Options: [cifar10, mnist, custom]. Note: Using a different dataset from the one on which the model was trained may result in an error if the model is not generalized enough
custom_data_dir: null # Required if dataset_name is 'custom': path to custom dataset. Leave it empty if the dataset_name is not custom
dataset_part: random # Required if dataset_name isn't 'custom'. Which part of dataset to use for attack. Options: [train, test, all, random]. Leave it empty if the dataset_name is custom
random_samples: 10 # Required if dataset_part is 'random'. Number of random samples for attack. Leave it empty if the dataset_part isn't random

# Attack Execution Configuration
batch_size: 32 # Batch size for attack execution
verbose: True # Whether to print progress of the attack. Defaults to True.
save_result_images: True # Whether to save the result images. Defaults to True.
result_images_dir: null # The path to the directory where the result images will be saved. If null, uses results/{attack_name}/{model_name}_{trained_on}_{dataset_name}_{dataset_part}_result_images.
result_images_prefix: null # The prefix to use for the result images. If null, uses {attack_name}_{model_name}_{trained_on}_{dataset_name}_{dataset_part}.
early_stopping: True # Whether to stop the attack when the attack is successful. Defaults to True.
early_stopping_threshold: 0.0001 # The improvement threshold for early stopping. Defaults to 0.0001. Only applicable if early_stopping is True. The attack stops when the improvement is less than the threshold for the last early_stopping_patience iterations.
early_stopping_patience: 10 # The patience for early stopping. Defaults to 10. Only applicable if early_stopping is True.

# Attack Specific Configuration
initial_delta: 0.1 # The initial delta value to be used for the Decision Boundary attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
initial_epsilon: 0.1 # The initial epsilon value to be used for the Decision Boundary attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
max_delta_trials: 10 # The maximum number of trials to be used for the Decision Boundary attack during orthogonal search
max_epsilon_trials: 10 # The maximum number of trials to be used for the Decision Boundary attack during forward search
max_iterations: 1000 # The maximum number of iterations to be used for the Decision Boundary attack
step_adapt: 0.9 # The step adapt value to be used to update the hyperparameters during the Decision Boundary attack
