AdvSecureNet is a Python library to for Machine Learning Security. It has been developed by [Melih Catal](https://github.com/melihcatal) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) as a part of his Master's Thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Manuel GÃ¼nther](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml/people/guenther.html). Currently, the main focus of the library is on adversarial attacks and defenses on vision tasks. However, it's planned to extend the library to support other tasks such as natural language processing.

The library provides a set of tools to generate adversarial examples and to evaluate the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. It also provides a set of tools to train robust machine learning models. The library is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). It is designed to be modular and extensible. So, anyone can easily run experiments with different configurations.

The library currently supports the following attacks:

- [FGSM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)
- [PGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)
- [DeepFool](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04599)
- [CW](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644)
- [LOTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06179)

The library currently supports the following defenses:

- [Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)
- [Ensemble Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07204)

The library supports any model that is implemented in PyTorch. It also provides a set of pre-trained models that can be used for experiments. It's also possible to create and use custom models.

The library supports multi-GPU training and adversarial training with DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) from PyTorch. This allows the library to be used for large-scale experiments.

## Installation

You can install the library using `pip`:

```bash
pip install advsecurenet
```

You can also install the library from source:

```bash
git clone
cd advsecurenet
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The library can be used as a command line tool or as an importable Python package.

### Command Line Tool

`advsecurenet` command can be used to interact with the library. You can use `advsecurenet --help` to see the available commands and options. Available commands are:

- `attack` Command to execute attacks.
- `config-default` Generate a default configuration file based on the name...
- `configs` Return the list of available configuration files.
- `defense` Command to execute defenses.
- `model-layers` Command to list the layers of a model.
- `models` Command to list available models.
- `test` Command to evaluate a model.
- `train` Command to train a model.
- `weights` Command to model weights.

You can use `advsecurenet <command> --help` to see the available options for a command. For example, you can use `advsecurenet attack --help` to see the available options for the `attack` command. The CLI supports both config yml files and arguments.

### Python Package

You can import the library as a Python package. You can use the `advsecurenet` module to access the library. You can find the available modules and classes in the [documentation](http://melihcatal.github.io/advsecurenet/).

## Examples

You can find various examples in the [examples](./examples/) directory. The examples show different use cases of the library and how to use the library as a Python package/CLI tool.

## Architecture

The high-level architecture of the library is shown in the figure below.
