# Description: Configuration file for the PGD attack to be used in adversarial training.

epsilon: 0.3 # The epsilon value to be used for the PGD attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
alpha: 0.008 # The alpha value to be used for the PGD attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
num_iter: 40 # The number of iterations to be used for the PGD attack. The higher the value, the more the perturbation
