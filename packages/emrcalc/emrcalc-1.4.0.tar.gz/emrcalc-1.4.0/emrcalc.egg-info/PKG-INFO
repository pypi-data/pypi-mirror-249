Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Calculator
==========================================

#### Overview

This project implements a Python 3.7+ Tkinter GUI to facilitate the following EMR calculations which I find useful as a student of Astrophysics:
- Conversion between Energy, Frequency, and Wavelength.
- Editing the units or quantities of any of those 3 characteristics.
- Display of the kJ/mol equivalent.
- Display of the related EMR band as defined by NASA.
- Automatic update of quantities and EMR band name after editing.

Some special files in addition to the emrcalc/*.py source code:
- ```HISTORY.txt``` - the update history
- ```misc/SCREENSHOT.png``` - a sample screenshot
- ```misc/url.txt``` - URLs to background information

#### Dependencies

```

tkinter - included with Python 3
tkinter.ttk - included with Python 3
```

#### Installation

```
