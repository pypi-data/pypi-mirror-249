# Description

Repository of differentially-private methods for learning from features.

# Usage
## Installation
`pip install dp-learning-ff`


## Private Prototype Calculation
1. Set your total privacy budget in (0,rho)-zCDP.
2. Divide your total budget into a budget per step. Good starting values are listed below. The algorithm will perform `len(Ps)` many steps.

```python
Ps = [rho] # One iteration
Ps = [5 / 64 * rho, 7 / 64 * rho, 52 / 64 * rho] # Three iterations
```

3. Call the private prototype calculation using your `train_preds`, `train_targets` and `Ps` as outlined above.

```python
num_samples = 100
dimensionality = 10
num_classes = 5
train_preds = np.random.normal(0,1,(num_samples, dimensionality))
train_targets = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=(num_samples)) # Supports unbalanced classes
private_prototypes = dp_learning_ff.give_private_prototypes(train_preds, train_targets, Ps)
>>> private_prototypes.shape
(5, 10)
>>> private_prototypes
