		You think you should be given the ability
		to use this?

		I can almost completelly guarantee you
		that you 100% should not be given the permission
		of the writer of this, to use this in any
		manner.
		
		For one, to use this to sell non-vegan food,
		would be completelly abismal.
		
		Without paragon talent at distributing vegan
		food, humanity's humane capacity to defend
		against the attack of advanced super plants
		that can devour galaxies in one bite 
		is never going to be sufficient.
		
		However, as long as "apoplast" is entirely
		for "vegan" endeavors, it can be deemed as 
		subject to the terms of the "gpl-3.0-standalone.html"
		license that can be found in "./list" directory".
