YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer - Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search

The YAQQ (Yaqq Another Quantum Quantizer) is an agent that searches for novel quantum gate sets. Given a gate set, it can find a complementary gate that performs better for a particular set of unitary transformations than the original gate set. It is possible theoretically because (a) there are an infinite number of ways of creating universal quantum computing gate sets - the ubiquity of quantum universality, (b) for each discrete gate set, there are certain quantum states that are easy to express, but many other quantum states which are exponentially costly - universal distribution for quantum automata. The cost, or the performance of a gate set, considers the fidelity when the gate set is used to decompose the target set of quantum transformations and the circuit complexity of the decomposition.

The theoretical foundation of this package, higher- and multi-order network models, was developed in the following works:
1. [RuliadTrotter: meta-modeling Metamathematical observers](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2575951)
2. [Visualizing Quantum Circuit Probability: Estimating Quantum State Complexity for Quantum Program Synthesis](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/5/763)
3. [Automated Quantum Software Engineering: why? what? how?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00619)
4. [Discovering Quantum Circuit Components with Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01707)
5. [Automated Gadget Discovery in Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12743)
6. The YAQQ name is inspired by the [YACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc) - a compiler-compiler, or a compiler-generator. In a similar way YAQQ provides the set of decompositions for the generated gate set.
