//! [`type_alias_impl_trait`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63063) is not stable yet.
//! So we can't write the following code:
//!
//! ```txt
//! impl Accessor for S3Backend {
//!     type Writer = impl oio::Write;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Which means we have to write the type directly like:
//!
//! ```txt
//! impl Accessor for OssBackend {
//!     type Writer = raw::TwoWays<
//!         oio::MultipartUploadWriter<OssWriter>,
//!         oio::AppendObjectWriter<OssWriter>,
//!     >;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This module is used to provide some enums for the above code. We should remove this module once
//! type_alias_impl_trait has been stabilized.
