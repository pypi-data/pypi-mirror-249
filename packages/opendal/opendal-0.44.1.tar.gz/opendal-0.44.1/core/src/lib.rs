//! Apache OpenDALâ„¢ is a data access layer that allows users to easily and
//! efficiently retrieve data from various storage services in a unified way.
//!
//! - Documentation: All docs are carried by self, visit [`docs`] for more.
//! - Services: All supported services could be found at [`services`].
//! - Layers: All builtin layer could be found at [`layers`].
//! - Features: All features could be found at [`features`][docs::features].
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use opendal::layers::LoggingLayer;
//! use opendal::services;
//! use opendal::Operator;
//! use opendal::Result;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Pick a builder and configure it.
//!     let mut builder = services::S3::default();
//!     builder.bucket("test");
//!
//!     // Init an operator
//!     let op = Operator::new(builder)?
//!         // Init with logging layer enabled.
//!         .layer(LoggingLayer::default())
//!         .finish();
//!
//!     // Write data
//!     op.write("hello.txt", "Hello, World!").await?;
//!
//!     // Read data
//!     let bs = op.read("hello.txt").await?;
//!
//!     // Fetch metadata
//!     let meta = op.stat("hello.txt").await?;
//!     let mode = meta.mode();
//!     let length = meta.content_length();
//!
//!     // Delete
//!     op.delete("hello.txt").await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
