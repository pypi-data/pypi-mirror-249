class sps_lib:
    """
    This class is meant as an example that can be easily adapted by the users
    to deal with other spectral templates libraries, different IMFs or
    different chemical abundances.

    Input Parameters
    ----------------

    filename:
        Name of a Numpy np.savez() file containing the following arrays for a
        given SPS models library, like FSPS, Miles, GALEXEV, BPASS,...

        1. templates[npixels, n_ages, n_metals] in erg/cm^2/s/A
        2. lam[npixels] in Angstroms in common to all the spectra (can be non-uniform)
        3. fwhm[npixels] or scalar in Angstroms, for the instrumental line-spread function
        4. ages[n_ages] for the spectra along the 2nd dimension
        5. metals[n_metals] for the spectra along the 3nd dimension
        6. masses[n_ages, n_metals] mass of living stars + remnants for each SPS

        This file can be created with a command like::

            np.savez_compressed(filename, templates=templates, masses=masses, 
                                lam=lam, ages=ages, metals=metals, fwhm=fwhm)

    velscale:
        desired velocity scale for the output templates library in km/s 
        (e.g. 60). This is generally the same or an integer fraction of the 
        ``velscale`` of the galaxy spectrum used as input to ``ppxf``.
    FWHM_gal: 
        scalar with the constant resolution of the galaxy in Angstroms, or
        dictionary with the wavelength and instrumental resolution of every
        pixel of the galaxy spectrum in Angstroms ``{"lam":lam, "fwhm":fwhm}``.
        
        If ``FWHM_gal=None`` (default), no convolution is performed.

    Optional Keywords
    -----------------

    age_range: array_like with shape (2,)
        ``[age_min, age_max]`` optional age range (inclusive) in Gyr for the 
        MILES models. This can be useful e.g. to limit the age of the templates 
        to be younger than the age of the Universe at a given redshift.
    metal_range: array_like with shape (2,)
        ``[metal_min, metal_max]`` optional metallicity [M/H] range (inclusive) 
        for the MILES models (e.g.`` metal_range = [0, np.inf]`` to select only
        the spectra with Solar metallicity and above).
    norm_range: array_like with shape (2,)
        A two-elements vector specifying the wavelength range in Angstroms 
        within which to compute the templates normalization
        (e.g. ``norm_range=[5070, 5950]`` for the FWHM of the V-band).

        If ``norm_range=None`` (default), the templates are not normalized
        individually, but instead are all normalized by the same scalar, given
        by the median of all templates.

    norm_type: {'mean', 'max', 'lbol'} optional
        * 'mean': the templates are normalized to ``np.mean(template[band]) = 1``
          in the given ``norm_range`` wavelength range. When this keyword is
          used, ``ppxf`` will output light weights, and ``mean_age_metal()``
          will provide light-weighted stellar population quantities.
        * 'max':  the templates are normalized to ``np.max(template[band]) = 1``.
        * 'lbol':  the templates are normalized to ``lbol(template[band]) = 1``,
          where ``lbol`` is the integrated luminosity in the given wavelength
          range. If ``norm_range=[-np.inf, np.inf]`` and the templates extend
          over a wide wavelength range, the normalization approximates the
          true bolometric luminosity.

        One can use the output attribute ``.flux`` to convert light-normalized
        weights into mass weights, without repeating the ``ppxf`` fit.
        However, when using regularization in ``ppxf`` the results will not
        be identical. In fact, enforcing smoothness to the light-weights is
        not quite the same as enforcing it to the mass-weights.
    wave_range: array_like with shape (2,)
        A two-elements vector specifying the wavelength range in Angstroms for
        which to extract the stellar templates. Restricting the wavelength
        range of the templates to the range of the galaxy data is useful to
        save some computational time. By default ``wave_range=[3541, 1e4]``

    Output Parameters
    -----------------

    Stored as attributes of the ``sps_lib`` class:

    .ages_grid: array_like with shape (n_ages, n_metals)
        Age in Gyr of every template.
    .flux: array_like with shape (n_ages, n_metals)
        If ``norm_range is not None`` then ``.flux`` contains the mean flux
        in each template spectrum within ``norm_range`` before normalization.

        When using the ``norm_range`` keyword, the weights returned by 
        ``ppxf`` represent light contributed by each SPS population template.
        One can then use this ``.flux`` attribute to convert the light weights
        into fractional masses as follows::

            pp = ppxf(...)                                  # Perform the ppxf fit
            light_weights = pp.weights[~gas_component]      # Exclude gas templates weights
            light_weights = light_weights.reshape(reg_dim)  # Reshape to a 2D matrix
            mass_weights = light_weights/miles.flux         # Divide by .flux attribute
            mass_weights /= mass_weights.sum()              # Normalize to sum=1

    .templates: array_like with shape (npixels, n_ages, n_metals)
        Logarithmically sampled array with the spectral templates in Lsun/A.
    .lam_temp: array_like with shape (npixels,)
        Wavelength in Angstroms of every pixel of the output templates.
    .ln_lam_temp: array_like with shape (npixels,)
        Natural logarithm of `.lam_temp`.
    .metals_grid: array_like with shape (n_ages, n_metals)
        Metallicity [M/H] of every template.
    .n_ages: 
        Number of different ages.
    .n_metal: 
        Number of different metallicities.
