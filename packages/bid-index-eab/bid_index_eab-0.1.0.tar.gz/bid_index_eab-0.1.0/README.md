This is the simplified version of the testbed proposed in the **Index Advisor (EA&B)** paper, which conducts a comprehensive assessment of the heuristic-based and the learning-based index advisors.

This package implements workflow of the index advisor: 

- **(1) Index Candidate Generation:** synthesizes promising index candidates using predefined strategies;
- **(2) Index Selection:** iterates over the generated index candidates and selects indexes based on the underlying selection mechanisms;
- **(3) Index Benefit Estimation:**  estimates the benefits of utilizing the selected indexes without actually building the indexes.
