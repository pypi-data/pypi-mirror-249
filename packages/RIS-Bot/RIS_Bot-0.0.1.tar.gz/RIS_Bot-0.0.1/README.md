### Description

A GPT2 model is to be extended to a new task via transfer learning. The GPT2 model is to be fine-tuned in such a way that it generates interactive, meditative and calming stories for the user.<br>
The aim is to create a reading experience that promotes positive thoughts.<br>
The language is English and the model is to be deployed on Discord.<br>
Interaction data from a user and a storyteller is required for the training data.<br>
Since such training data is difficult to obtain, ChatGPT is used to generate the data.<br>

This branch is the PyPI implentation for the model. It provides the model itself and functionality to inference the model.
