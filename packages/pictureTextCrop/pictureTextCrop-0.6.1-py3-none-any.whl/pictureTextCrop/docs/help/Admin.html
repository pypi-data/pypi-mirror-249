    <h4 align="center"><b>Admin Menu</b></h4>
    <p><br>
      <b>Configuration:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>This selection launches the multi-tabbed configuration
      dialog.&nbsp; There are three pages, 'General', 'Jobs', and 'DB
      Mapping'.&nbsp; The 'General' page options are not currently
      implemented.&nbsp; They are primarily convenience options and will
      be available in a future release.&nbsp; The 'Jobs' option is the
      important one since with it you can configure two default options
      available for defining and running jobs.&nbsp; The one available
      during job definition is 'Default Folder Scan Mode", which can be
      set to either 'Walk' or 'List'.&nbsp; This is only the default
      option when the Job Definition dialog is started and can be
      changed in the dialog.&nbsp; The 'Default Run Mode' can also be
      set here, and again this is only the default and can be changed
      when a job is selected for running.&nbsp; The two modes available
      are 'Sequence' and 'Batch' and work as explained for the 'Run"
      main menu sub menu.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The configuration page 'DB Mapping' is not yet implemented, but
      the page explains the feature that will be implemented in a future
      release.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Jobs:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>This selection launches the 'Job Definition' dialog.&nbsp; With
      this dialog you can define jobs to run giving each your selection
      of files to include and providing each with a unique identifier
      and a job type.&nbsp; As is true elsewhere in the application, all
      controls in this dialog have clear tool tips which can be used to
      understand the features that they control.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>When you click the "Add Files' button, the usual file system
      navigator appears and allowes you to select any number or sequence
      of files or folders using the mouse with or without the CTRL and
      SHIFT keys (See the Files menu help tab for details). When you
      select a folder, only its path is included in the file list but
      all files in it, scanned according to the 'Scan Mode' you select
      before launching the navigator, will be present in the file
      list.&nbsp; When the job is run, the files and folders in it will
      be processed in the order they appear in in the list.<br>
