    <h4 align="center"><b>Run Menu</b></h4>
    <p><b><br>
        Sequence:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>This feature is like the feature launched by the '<b><font
          color="#3333ff">&gt;&gt;</font></b>' icon button in the icon
      tool bar.&nbsp; Its tool tip reads, "
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
        charset=windows-1252">
      Display each selected image in turn in the text cropping dialog
      and store its cropped text in the CropLog table."&nbsp; (The
      status line at the bottom also shows help for each menu item and
      button.)&nbsp; The only difference is that it will only display
      the image files in the list that have been checked.&nbsp;
      Selecting them using the mouse on the file path itself will not
      include them.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b><br>
        Batch:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>Like the "Sequence" feature in the same menu, this will operate
      on all files in the image file list that are selected using the
      checkbox.&nbsp; The difference is that it will extract all of the
      text from each in turn without showing a dialog and will store the
      extracted text in a record in the BatchMaster table in the
      TextExtraction.db database.&nbsp; The file's path is one of the
      fields stored, but since it is not the key field, multiple
      extractions from the same file will have separate records with
      different time stamps.&nbsp; This allows you to check for
      modifications of image files over time, such a might occur if
      there is tampering with them.&nbsp; The fields stored in the
      record include the time-stamp of the extraction process, the full
      file path, the text extracted, and in the info field the 'stat' of
      the file at the time the text was extracted.&nbsp; This is simply
      the file meta-data available from the operating system, which
      includes such items as the last modified time-stamp, the file
      size, and the access restrictions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>An alternative is to use the button on the icon tool bar with the
      circular arrow icon and the help text, "Extract all text from all
      files in the list and store it in the BatchMaster table
      <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
        charset=windows-1252">
      ."&nbsp; This ignores both the check boxes and any list selections
      you might have made and simply extracts all text from all of the
      files in the list.&nbsp; This should be used with caution as
      depending on the number of files in the list, this could take a
      long time.&nbsp; Basic progress will be displayed on in the
      console.&nbsp; For more detailed and complete reporting, use the
      Jobs definition and running features.</p>
    <p><br>
      <b>Job:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>Use this feature to select and run a job that you defined using
      the Admin -&gt; Jobs main menu selection or the toolbox icon
      button in the icon tool bar.&nbsp; These launch the "Job
      Definition" dialog in which you can select files and folders to
      include in any order in a sequence or batch and then save the job
      for use later under a name you provide.&nbsp; You cash also
      specify a job type, although this feature is not yet developed to
      the point where a list of already entered job types are displayed
      for your selection in this dialog. Once you have reviewed the help
      on how to define a job, come back to this page to see how one is
      run.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When you select this menu item, a dialog with the title "Select
      and RUN Job" will be launched.&nbsp; It displays a list of the
      names of jobs that you have defined from which you can select one
      to run.&nbsp; There are two modes in which you can run a
      job:&nbsp; Sequence, and Batch.&nbsp; These work like the Sequence
      and Batch selections previously described for this Run menu
      (above).&nbsp; Batch mode has an additional feature
      available.&nbsp; If you select Batch from the menu button labelled
      "Run Mode:" at the top, A help message displays at the bottom
      along with a Console Output configuration panel.&nbsp; Since Batch
      Jobs can take significant time to run, you can select the items
      you want displayed as each file is processed by the text
      extraction engine.&nbsp; Selecting "File Path" will provide s
      count of the files processed along with the full path of each file
      as it is processed.&nbsp; Selecting "Times and Durations" will
      also display the start and end time for each file along with the
      time it took to extract the text.&nbsp; This also provides the
      start and end times for the entire batch and its duration.&nbsp;
      Choosing "Statistics" only provides the byte count of the text
      extracted currently, although more is possible in the future
      depending on interest.&nbsp; Selecting "Text Extracted" should be
      used with caution since it will cause the entire text extracted to
      be written go the console after the other items selected have been
      displayed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Like the rest of the application, all of the buttons and other
      controls have brief help displayed in their tool tips and at the
      same time in the status bar at the bottom.<br>
