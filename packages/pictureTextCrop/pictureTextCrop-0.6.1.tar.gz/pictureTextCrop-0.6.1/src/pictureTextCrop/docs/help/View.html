    <b>Image Size:</b><br>
    <br>
    This menu controls the scaling or size of the image displayed in the
    scrollable panel on the right side of the main application window
    content area.&nbsp; The submenu includes the selections: 'Fit
    Frame', 'Original', 'Larger', Smaller', and 'to Dialog'. These are
    fairly self explanatory.&nbsp; 'Original' displays the image in its
    original pixel dimensions in the scroll area, meaning if it is a
    screen shot, it will be the size of the screen it was taken
    of.&nbsp; 'Smaller' and 'Larger' change the size by 10% per click,
    and 'to Dialog' opens the text cropping dialog for the image showing
    it in its original dimensions.<br>

    <b>ToolBars:</b><br>
    <br>
    This menu selection has a sub menu of check boxes which control
    whether either of the two tool bars are visible.&nbsp; There are by
    default two toolbars visible when the application starts, one with
    only icons and one with only text buttons.&nbsp; Each has a somewhat
    different set of features. but all buttons have clear help text in
    their tool tips and the help displayed in the status bar at the
    bottom.&nbsp; Either tool bar can be moved to any border of the main
    window and can be stacked with the other there.&nbsp; Using the
    check boxes in the ToolBars sub menu, you can also control which is
    visible at any time.<br>
