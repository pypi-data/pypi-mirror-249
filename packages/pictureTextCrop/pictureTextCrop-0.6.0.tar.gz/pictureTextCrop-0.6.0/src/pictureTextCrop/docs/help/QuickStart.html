      <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This
          application can be run by installing the python package
          dependencies using pip and then simply unzipping the source
          archive, pictureTextCrop.tar.gz into a new directory that you
          create to contain the application and its files.&nbsp; The
          python packages required, available at PyPI.org, include one
          rather large one, PyQt5.&nbsp; The complete list of packages
          required is: PyQt5, pytesseract, and Pillow, which is included
          as a library module in current releases of Python.</font></p>

      <ol>
        <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Download the
            source code archive from the GitHub account:
            PictureTextCrop-main.zip.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Put it in a folder

        <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Go into the

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a console / terminal in
            this folder.&nbsp; This is the working folder for the
            application.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Check your python

        <b>Introduction:</b><br>
        <br>
        This application is a simple tool which allows you to
        interactively extract text from image files by dragging from the
        top-left corner of a crop rectangle to the bottom-right corner.
        When you release the mouse button the text inside the rectangle
        is printed to the console and a record of the conversion and its
        result is made in the SQLite3 database, TextExtraction.db, in
        the CropLog table. Each record of this table records the date
        and time of the extraction in its timeStamp field, the full path
        to the file on your disk of the image file in the filePath
        field, the coordinates of the crop in the coordinates field, and
        the text of the crop in the text field. The value of storing all
        extractions in a database table is simply that you can then
        search large numbers of images containing particular text using
        SQL.<br>
        <br>
        The image formats recognized are those recognized by the PyQy5
        QImageReader class, which includes those associated with the
        following file extensions:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'bmp', 'cur', 'gif', 'icns', 'ico', 'jpeg',
        'jpg', 'mng', 'pbm', 'pgm', 'png', 'ppm', 'svg', 'svgz', 'tga',
        'tif', 'tiff', 'wbmp', 'webp', 'xbm', 'xpm'<br>
        <br>
        The application main window displays a list on the left which
        will contain the paths of the image files identified when you
        select folders to scan.&nbsp; In the right half of the dialog
        will be a space which shows the image selected when you click on
        a file path in the list.&nbsp; The dialog can be resized to
        accommodate your needs.<br>
        <br>
        To extract text from an image, select the checkbox located to
        the left of it and click on the "Select Image Text" button in
        the button-bar at the top. You can select multiple files and a
        text selection dialog will be stacked up for each. Press the
        left mouse button at the top left of a rectangle containing the
        text you want to extract and then drag to the lower right
        corner. When you release the button the extracted text is
        printed to the console and a record of the extraction and its
        result is made in the SQLite3 database. You can do this as many
        times as you like for each image. A separate CropLog record will
        be made for each.<br>
        <b><br>
          <br>
        </b><b>Batch Mode:</b><br>
        <br>
        If you click on the "Batch Process" button in the tool bar the
        application will extract all of the text from each of the files
        in the folder scan list. This process can take some time, my own
        trials on my ordinary laptop resulting in a pace of more than 5
        seconds per image, sometimes 15 or so. With only 50 images, the
        process could take up to 10 minutes. The resulting extracted
        text will be placed into the BatchMaster table in the SQLite3
        database. The fields written in each record in include the
        extraction TimeStamp, the FolderPath, the FileName, the Text,
        and the file metadata in the Info field. Views for reviewing the
        file metadata and other components saved in convenient formats
        are planned.<br>

        <br>
        When processing digital evidence you must be careful to preserve
        the file metadata, especially the time stamps. <br>
        Know how operating systems treat timestamps and permissions when
        you copy files and how your archiving applications do as well. <br>
