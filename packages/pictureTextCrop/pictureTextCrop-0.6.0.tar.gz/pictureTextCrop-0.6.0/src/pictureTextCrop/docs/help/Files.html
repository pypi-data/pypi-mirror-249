    <h4 align="center"><b>Files Menu</b></h4>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Scan Folder:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>This is the first selection in the Files menu of the main menu of
      the application.&nbsp; It is used to launch a folder selection
      navigation dialog with which you can select folders for the
      application to scan for image files.&nbsp; The image files found
      will be included in the list which is on the left side of the
      content area of the main application window.&nbsp; 'Scan Folder'
      has a submenu with two selections, 'Walk', and 'List'.&nbsp; If
      you select 'Walk', all of the folders that you select in the
      navigator will be scanned recursively down to the depth of the
      folder hierarchy and any image files contained in them will be
      included in the list.&nbsp; If you select 'List', then only the
      image files in the folder itself, but none of its sub-folders,
      will be included.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>You may use the CTRL and SHIFT keys in combination with mouse
      clicks to select ranges or sets of folders to scan.&nbsp; With the
      CTRL key / mouse click combination, you can select multiple
      individual folders, and with the SHIFT key / mouse click
      combination you can select ranges.&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar
      with these standard list and tree view features, experiment a bit
      to learn how they work.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Click the [Cancel] button at the bottom of the file system
      navigator to cancel selection and exit the dialog.&nbsp; Click the
      [Select] button to perform the scan, exit the navigator, and list
      the image files found in the main application window.&nbsp; The
      full path of each file is shown.&nbsp; The [Up] button is useful
      if you have descended into sub-folders by double clicking folders
      and want to go back up in the folder hierarchy.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b><br>
        Select Text:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>Use this selection to select or crop text from one or more of the
      image files in the list.&nbsp; Each image file in the list has a
      check box to its left.&nbsp; To select the file for text cropping,
      click on the check box to select it.&nbsp; Only those files with
      the check box clicked will be shown during the cropping
      operation.&nbsp; Selecting this menu item causes a series of
      dialogs to appear, each containing the image in each of the files
      checked.&nbsp; With the image displayed in the cropping dialog,
      drag the mouse from the top left corner of the text to crop to the
      bottom right.&nbsp; Releasing the mouse button starts the cropping
      operation, which might take a couple of seconds depending on how
      much text you selected.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The cropped text will be written to the console, so if you
      started the application using a console command then the text will
      be available there.&nbsp; It is also written to the database in
      the SQLite database file, TextExtraction.db, which, depending on
      your particular installation method, will be in the same folder as
      the pictureTextCrop.py source code file.&nbsp; Whichever directory
      this file is in when the application is started is its working
      directory, which will be where it initializes and stores its
      database.&nbsp; When you crop text from an image, a record is
      written to the CropLog table.&nbsp; The record will contain fields
      recording the a time-stamp showing when the extraction was done in
      a text sortable format, the full file path identifying the file on
      your storage media, the text extracted, and the coordinates of the
      rectangle you drew in the image defining the boundaries of the
      text extraction.&nbsp; This can be searched and otherwise used
      efficiently using SQL, and so serves as an export point for the
      payload produced by the application.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The cropping dialog for each file will remain displayed until you
      close it using the standard X button at its top right
      corner.&nbsp; You can continue to crop any number of pieces of
      text in it until it is closed.&nbsp; You can work in any order
      through the files you checked in the list to crop using the
      'Select Text' feature in the Files menu.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      <b>Select All:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>This is a toggle with which you can select and un-select&nbsp;
      all of the files in the list.&nbsp; Notice that it does not check
      all of the boxes to the right of the file paths, but rather
      highlights all of the files.&nbsp; This selection method only
      works with certain features, one of which is accessed with the
      button in the icon tool bar with the blue double-play arrows, '<b><font
          color="#3333ff">&gt;&gt;</font></b>'.&nbsp; All files in the
      list which are highlighted will be displayed one at a time in the
      crop dialog when you select this feature.&nbsp; In addition to
      selecting all of the files in the list at once, you can select
      files in the list using the same CTRL- and SHIFT-plus-mouse-click
      operations that you can use in the file system navigator for
      selecting multiple folders.&nbsp; When you click on the '<b><font
          color="#3333ff">&gt;&gt;</font></b>' button, the crop dialog
      will display for each of the highlighted files in turn.&nbsp; You
      can select one slice of text from each.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      <b>Exit:</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>This selection exits the application.&nbsp; <br>
