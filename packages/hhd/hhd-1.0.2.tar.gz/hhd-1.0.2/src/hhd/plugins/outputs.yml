    title: Virtual Controller
    hint: >-
      Creates a virtual `Handheld Daemon Controller` that can be used normally
      in apps. Back buttons are supported but steam will not detect them.
      If Gyroscope or Accelerometer are enabled, a Motion device will be
      created as well (experimental; works in Dolphin).

    title: Dualsense
    hint: >-
      Emulates the expensive Dualsense Sony controller, both Edge and non-edge
      variants.

      led_support:
        type: bool
        title: LED Support
        hint: >-
          Passes through the LEDs to the controller, which allows games
          to control them.
        default: True

      bluetooth_mode:
        type: bool
        title: Bluetooth Mode
        tags: [advanced]
        hint: >-
          Emulates the controller in bluetooth mode instead of USB mode.
          This is the default as it causes less issues with how apps
          interact with the controller.
          However, using USB mode can improve LED support (?) in some games.
          Test and report back!
        default: True

      edge_mode:
        type: bool
        title: Edge Mode
        hint: >-
          Uses the edge product ID which enables paddle support.
          The edge controller is a bit obscure, so some games might not
          support it correctly.
          You can disable this to use normal Dualsense.
          The paddles are then remapped to touchpad clicks (left, right).
        default: True
