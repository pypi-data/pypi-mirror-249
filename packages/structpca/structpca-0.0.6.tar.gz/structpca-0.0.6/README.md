# CONTRIBUTING
You should run
```pre-commit install```
in the repo directory before commiting (if ```pre-commit``` is not installed,
you can pip install it). This will make sure each python file is well
formated and pylint will check the code before any commit. You can check the ```.pre-commit-config.yaml``` file for more details on pylint configuration.
