## Examples

### Generic from file name
```python
from pycaptions import Captions

with Captions("tests/test.en.srt") as captions:
    captions.saveVTT("test")
```

### Generic from file stream
```python
with open("tests/test.en.srt", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
    captions = Captions(f) # or captions = Captions()
                           # captions.read(f)
    captions.saveVTT("test")
```

### Generic from string
```python
srt = """1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
This is a test file
"""
captions = Captions(srt) # or captions = Captions()
                         # captions.detect(srt)
captions.saveVTT("test")
```

### Specific reader
Have the same functions as generic, except

```python
from pycaptions import SubRip, detectSRT

with open("tests/test.en.srt", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
    if detectSRT(f): # or SubRip.detect(f)
        captions = SubRip().read(f)
        captions.saveVTT("test")
```

### Multilingual
```python
from pycaptions import Captions

# if the format supports multiple languages
with Captions("tests/test.ttml") as captions:
    # first line will be in english, second one in spanish
    captions.saveSRT("test", ["en","es"]) 
    
# if you have multiple files and you want to make multilingual one
with Captions("tests/test.en.srt") as captions:
    with Captions("tests/test.es.srt") as captions2:
        # only subtitle text and comments (if format supports them) are added
        captions+=captions2 
    # first line will be in english, second one in spanish
    captions.save("test", ["en","es"]) 
```

### Combine files
```python
with Captions("tests/test.en.srt") as captions:
    captions.joinFile("tests/test.en.srt", add_end_time=True)
    captions.save("test")
```
