# pagerduty-auto-ack

Sometimes you can not acknowledge an incident manually, but you also can not really respond to it.
These are (and should be when you are on-call) usually short moments, taking about 15-20 minutes.
A good example here is taking a shower.
In such cases you may want to automatically acknowledge the incidents, to prevent loud notifications or calls from
disturbing other people.

This script monitors the incidents that are assigned to you and acks them if needed.
At the end of execution (when stopped with C^c) it displays the incidents that it acknowledged.

```
usage: pagerduty-auto-ack [-h] --pagerduty-api-key PAGERDUTY_API_KEY [--interval INTERVAL] [--urgency {high,low}]

Monitor and automatically ACKnowledge PagerDuty incidents

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pagerduty-api-key   PAGERDUTY_API_KEY
  --interval INTERVAL   how often (in seconds) to run the check
  --urgency {high,low}  defaults to all urgencies
```

## Requirements

It requires a user-level API key to run.
This API key starts with the `u+` prefix and can be generated by following the [PagerDuty API docs](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#section-generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key).

## How to run it

Fast and easy way is to use `pipx`:

```
pipx install pagerduty-auto-ack
pagerduty-auto-ack --pagerduty-api-key <api_key>
```

For development you can clone the repo and run the script with `poetry`:

```
poetry install
poetry run pagerduty-auto-ack --pagerduty-api-key <api_key>
```
