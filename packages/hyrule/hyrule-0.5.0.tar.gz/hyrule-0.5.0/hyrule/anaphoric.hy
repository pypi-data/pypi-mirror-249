;;; Hy anaphoric macros
"The anaphoric macros module makes functional programming in Hy very
concise and easy to read.

    An anaphoric macro is a type of programming macro that
    deliberately captures some form supplied to the macro which may be
    referred to by an anaphor (an expression referring to another).

(defmacro ap-if [test-form then-form [else-form None]]
  "As :ref:`if <if>`, but the result of the test form is named ``it`` in

(defmacro ap-each-while [xs form #* body]
  "As ``ap-each``, but the form ``pred`` is run before the body forms on

  "As ``ap-map``, but the predicate function ``predfn`` (yes, that's a
  function, not an anaphoric form) is applied to each ``it``, and the
  anaphoric mapping form ``rep`` is only applied if the predicate is true.
  Otherwise, ``it`` is yielded unchanged.

  Examples:
    ::

       => (list (ap-map-when (fn [x] (% x 2)) (* it 2) [1 2 3 4]))
       [2 2 6 4]

(defmacro! ap-reduce [form o!xs [initial-value None]]
  "This macro is an anaphoric version of :py:func:`functools.reduce`. It works
  as follows:

  - Bind ``acc`` to the first element of ``xs``, bind ``it`` to the
    second, and evaluate ``form``.
  - Bind ``acc`` to the result, bind ``it`` to the third value of ``xs``,
    and evaluate ``form`` again.
  - Bind ``acc`` to the result, and continue until ``xs`` is exhausted.

  If ``initial-value`` is supplied, the process instead begins with
  ``acc`` set to ``initial-value`` and ``it`` set to the first element of
  ``xs``.

  Examples:
    ::

       => (ap-reduce (+ it acc) (range 10))
       45"
  `(let [acc None  it None]
    (setv acc ~(if (is initial-value None)

(defmacro ap-when [test-form #* body]
  "As :ref:`when <when>`, but the result of the test form is named ``it`` in

(defmacro ap-with [form #* body]
  "As :ref:`with <with>`, but the result of the form is named ``it`` in

(defreader %
  "Makes an expression into a function with an implicit ``%`` parameter list.

  A ``%i`` symbol designates the (1-based) *i* th parameter (such as ``%3``).
  Only the maximum ``%i`` determines the number of ``%i`` parameters--the
  others need not appear in the expression.
  ``%*`` and ``%**`` name the ``#*`` and ``#**`` parameters, respectively.

  Examples:
    ::

       => (#%[%1 %6 42 [%2 %3] %* %4] 1 2 3 4 555 6 7 8)
       [1 6 42 [2 3] #(7 8) 4]

    ::

       => (#% %** :foo 2)
       {\"foo\" 2}

    When used on an s-expression,
    ``#%`` is similar to Clojure's anonymous function literals--``#()``::

       => (setv add-10 #%(+ 10 %1))
       => (add-10 6)
       16

  .. note::
    ``#%`` determines the parameter list by the presence of a ``%*`` or ``%**``
    symbol and by the maximum ``%i`` symbol found *anywhere* in the expression,
    so nesting of ``#%`` forms is not recommended."
