           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# PartCAD <!-- omit in toc -->

[![License](https://github.com/openvmp/partcad/blob/main//apache20.svg?raw=true)](./LICENSE.txt)

PartCAD is the first package manager for CAD models,
and a Python package to consume these packages in CAD scripts ([`cadquery`][CadQuery] and [`build123d`][build123d]).
It brings the same power to CAD scripting
as [pip](https://pypi.org/) to Python,
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to JavaScript,
[maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to Java etc.
Though it aims to achieve the integrity and security properties of
[bazel](https://bazel.build/) which makes PartCAD quite distinct from `pip` and `npm`.

PartCAD allows to maintain information about mechanical parts,
how they come together to form larger assemblies,
and to reuse the same parts in multiple assemblies, multiple projects.
The implementation of parts can change over time
(e.g. optimize or migrate to [CadQuery] from [STEP]) without the need to update
all of the consumers.

## Installation

The recommended method to install PartCAD for most users is:

```shell
pip install partcad
```

For contributors:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openvmp/partcad.git
cd partcad
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

PartCAD works best when [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) is installed.
Moreover, on Windows it is recommended to run and build PartCAD from within a `conda`
environment.

## Browse models published to PartCAD

To browse the public PartCAD repository from the command line:

```sh
$ pc init # to initialize new PartCAD package in the current folder
$ pc list # to list all available packages
$ pc list-parts -r # to list all parts in all available packages
$ pc list-assemblies -r # to list all assemblies in all available packages
```

The web UI to browse the public PartCAD repository is not yet published.

## Consume PartCAD models

As PartCAD has no implicit dependencies built in, the current directory needs to be initialized as a PartCAD package and a dependency on the public PartCAD repository needs to be registered.

```sh
# Initialize new PartCAD package in the current folder
$ pc init
```

Alternatively, manually create `partcad.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
# partcad.yaml
import:
  partcad-index: # Standard public PartCAD repository (needs to be explicitly referenced to be used)
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/openvmp/partcad-index.git
```

After this, PartCAD python module can be used to retrieve any model.
The exact way to do this depends on the CAD framework used in your project:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<code># CadQuery
import cadquery as cq
import partcad as pc
part = pc.get_part(
     # Part name
     "fastener/screw-buttonhead",
     # Package name
     "standard-metric-cqwarehouse",
).get_cadquery()
...
show_object(part)</code>
</td>
<td>
<code># build123d
import build123d as b3d
import partcad as pc
part = pc.get_part(
     # Part name
     "fastener/screw-buttonhead",
     # Package name
     "standard-metric-cqwarehouse",
).get_build123d()
...
show_object(part)</code>
</td>
<!--
<td>
<code># No framework, standalone
import partcad as pc
part = pc.get_part(
     # Part name
     "fastener/screw-buttonhead",
     # Package name
     "standard-metric-cqwarehouse",
).get_build123d()
...
pc.finalize(part)</code>
</td>
-->
</tr>
</table>


## Create PartCAD models

This frameworks allows to create large models and scenes, one part at a time,
while having parts and assemblies often maintained by third parties.

### Parts

PartCAD allows to define parts using any of the following methods:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Method</td>
<th>Example</td>
<th>Result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303">STEP</a></td>
<td>
<code># partcad.yaml
parts:
    bolt:
        type: step</code>

<br/>
Store the model in "bold.step"
</td>
<td><img src="https://github.com/openvmp/partcad/blob/main/examples/part_step/bolt.png?raw=true"></td>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery">CadQuery</a></td>
<td>
<code># partcad.yaml
parts:
    cube:
        type: cadquery</code>
<br/>
<br/>
Place the CadQuery script in "cube.py"
</td>
<td><img src="https://github.com/openvmp/partcad/blob/main/examples/part_cadquery_primitive/cube.png?raw=true"></td>
<tr>
https://github.com/openvmp/partcad/blob/main/examples/assembly_logo/logo.png?raw=true
<tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com/gumyr/build123d">build123d</a></td>
<td>
<code># partcad.yaml
parts:
    cube:
        type: build123d</code>

<br/>
Place the build123d script in "cube.py"
</td>
<td><img src="https://github.com/openvmp/partcad/blob/main/examples/part_cadquery_primitive/cube.png?raw=true"></td>
<tr>
</table>

Other methods to define parts are coming in soon (e.g. SCAD).

### Assemblies

Assemblies are defined as parametrized instructions how to put parts and other
assemblies together.

Currently, PartCAD allows to define parts only using ASSY (Assembly YAML):

<table>
<tr>
<th>Example</td>
<th>Result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code># partcad.yaml
assemblies:
    logo:
        type: assy</code>

<br/>
<code># logo.assy
links:
  - part: bone
    package: example_part_cadquery_logo
    location: [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], 0]
  - part: bone
    package: example_part_cadquery_logo
    location: [[0,0,-2.5], [0,0,1], -90]
  - part: head_half
    package: example_part_cadquery_logo
    name: head_half_1
    location: [[0,0,27.5], [0,0,1], 0]
  - part: head_half
    package: example_part_cadquery_logo
    name: head_half_2
    location: [[0,0,25], [0,0,1], -90]
  - part: bolt
    package: example_part_step
    location: [[0,0,7.5], [0,0,1], 0]</code>
</td>
<td><img src="https://github.com/openvmp/partcad/blob/main/examples/assembly_assy/logo.png?raw=true"></td>
<tr>
</table>

### Packages

Each project that produces or consumes PartCAD models is a separate PartCAD package.
Each package may export parts, assemblies and scenes.
Each package may import parts, assemblies and scenes from its dependencies
(other PartCAD packages).

The full syntax is below:

```yaml
import:
    <package-name>:
        desc: <(optional) textual description>
        type: <git|tar|local>
        path: <(local only) relative-path>
        url: <(git|tar only) url-of-the-package>
        relPath: <(git|tar only) relative-path-within-the-repository>
        web: <(optional) package or maintainer's url>
        poc: <(optional) maintainer's email>
        pythonVersion: <(optional) python version for sandboxing if applicable>
```

### Troubleshooting

At the moment, the best way to troubleshoot PartCAD is to use VS Code with `OCP CAD Viewer`.
Any part or assembly can be displayed in `OCP CAD Viewer` by running `pc show <part> [<package>]` or `pc show -a <assembly> [<package>]` in a terminal view.

```sh
# Create a temporary folder
mkdir /tmp/test_show && cd /tmp/test_show

# Initialize a package with the default dependency on public PartCAD repository
pc init

# Show one of available parts in 'OCP CAD Viewer'
pc show fastener/screw-buttonhead standard-metric-cqwarehouse
```

### Render your project

Use `pc render` to render PartCAD parts and assemblies
in the current package (the current directory).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openvmp/partcad-cqwarehouse.git
cd partcad-cqwarehouse
pc render
```

### Publishing

It is very simple to publish your package to the public PartCAD repository.

First, you need to publish your own package which defines the models you want to publish.
Then create a pull request in [the public PartCAD repo](https://github.com/openvmp/partcad) to add a reference to your package.

## Export

### Images

Individual parts, assemblies and scenes can be rendered and exported into the
following formats:

- PNG
- [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) (not yet)
- [STEP] (not yet)
- ...

### Other modelling formats

Additionally, assemblies and scenes can be exported into the following formats:

- [SDF](http://sdformat.org/) (not yet / in progress)
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) project (not yet / in progress)
- ...

### Purchasing / Bill of materials

The bill of materials for each assembly can be produced using the following
formats:

- [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (not yet / in progress)
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (not yet / in progress)

## Security

PartCAD is capable of rendering scripted parts
([CadQuery] and [build123d] use Python) in sandboxed environments.

While at the moment it is only useful from dependency management perspective,
in the future PartCAD aims to achieve security isolation of the sandboxed
environments. That will fundamentally change the security implications of using
scripted models shared online.

## Tools for mechanical engineering

Here is an overview of the open source tools to maintain
mechanical projects. It shows where does this framework fit
in the modern mechanical development workflows.

## History

PartCAD is the evolution of the modelling framework that was once used
internally in [OpenVMP](https://github.com/openvmp/openvmp-models).
It is now being maintained separately as a generic tool.

The motivation behind this framework is to build a packaging and dependency
tracking layer on top of both [CadQuery]/[build123d] and traditional CAD tools to
enable version control and other features required for effective collaboration. 

This framework currently uses [build123d] and, thus, [OpenCASCADE] under the hood.
However this may change in the future, if the python C bindings for [OpenCASCADE]
remain a blocker for unlocking multithreaded performance.
