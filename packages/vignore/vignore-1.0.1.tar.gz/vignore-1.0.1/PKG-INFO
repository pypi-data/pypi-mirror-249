# vignore

It is been a while that I hate to write ignore files, be it `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore` or `.fdignore`.

I failed to get the right files included, and failed to exclude unwanted files.

No more shooting in the blind! Visualize your ignore files and get instant feedback in intuitive representations.

## Binary requirements

You need to install [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), a fast `find` alternative.

You need to run this under a Unix-like OS.

## Install

```
pip3 install vignore
```

## Usage

The `diffpath` shall be absolute to the directory you want to visualize.

Commandline help:

```
usage: vignore [-h] -d DIFFPATH

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIFFPATH, --diffpath DIFFPATH
                        Path to visualize ignored files
```

## Demo

To be added.
