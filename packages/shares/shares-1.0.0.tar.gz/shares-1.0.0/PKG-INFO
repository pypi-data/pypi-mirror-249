<code>

Started from the shell, 
"shares" presents files in the 
current working directory (cwd) 
that have extension "s.HTML".

<code>
	[tcsh] shares
</code>


<code>
	<pre>
		<h1>This is an example html file.</h1>
		<p>It really only needs the "pre" tag to look like a reflection of its contents in a browser.</p>
		<p>Tags like "html" and "body" are actually not necessary for rendering HTML in modern browsers.</p>
	
		<p>for text to wrap, instead of extending off the page, style "white-space: pre-wrap" can be utilized.</p>
	</pre>
