## What is it?

**nvcc4jupyter** is a Jupyter Notebook plugin that provides cell and line
[magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)
to allow running CUDA C++ code from a notebook. This is especially
useful when combined with a hosted service such a Google's
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which provide CUDA capable GPUs
and you can start learning CUDA C++ without having to install anything or even
to own a GPU yourself.
