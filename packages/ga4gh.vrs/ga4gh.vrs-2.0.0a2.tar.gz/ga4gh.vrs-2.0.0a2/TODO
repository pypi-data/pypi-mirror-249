** when to compute id
** how to serialize

** Translocation
** Copy Number
** VariationSet
** Standards
** Genotype := Hap|All



* presentation

** uses
observation: precise ⇒ interpretation/consequence (e.g., g. → c. → p. → protein loss)
annotation: "protein loss" ← caused by any of ... 
⇒ different needs and interpretations
e.g., del -- precise in an observation
but for curation, less when associated with fuzzy coordinates. Does
11q22.3 del mean 1) del of that region exactly, 2) del within that
region, 3) del of a larger region that subsumes, or 4) del of an
region that partially overlaps?



** decomposition


* vmc (spec)

** update tests

** Consider DeletionState
DeletionState(type=WITHIN|EXACT|CONTAINING|OVERLAPPING)

* vmc-python

** digest: handle sorting and remove id before digest

** make sequence ac translation optional

** implement localizer

** implement VOCA normalization


* anyvar

** accept alt import formats

** expand option
