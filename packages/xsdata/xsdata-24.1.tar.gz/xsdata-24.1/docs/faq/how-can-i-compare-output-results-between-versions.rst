How can I compare output results between versions
======================================================

The code generator comes with a config option to include
generation info to all the output fules.



.. code-block:: console

    $ xsdata generate --include-header schema.xsd


.. code-block:: python

    """This file was generated by xsdata, v22.12, on 2023-02-22 10:22:57

    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
