Propertime is an attempt at implementing proper time management in Python,
by fully embracing the extra complications due to how we measure an manage
time as humans instead of just negating them.

In a nutshell, it provides two main classes: the ``Time`` class for representing
time (similar to a datetime) and the ``TimeUnit`` class for representing units
of time (similar to timedelta). Such classes play nice with Python datetimes so
that you can mix and match and use them only when needed.

You can have a look at the README for a better introduction, some example usage
and more info about Propertime; and you can get started by having a look at the
[quickstart notebook](https://github.com/sarusso/Propertime/blob/main/Quickstart.ipynb),
or by reading the [reference documentation](https://propertime.readthedocs.io).
