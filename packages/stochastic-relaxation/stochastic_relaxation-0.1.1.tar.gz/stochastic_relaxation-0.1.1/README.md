# Stochastic Relaxation Integration (Python)
Python integrators implemented in pure python for my Honors Thesis at ASU.
* OVRVO
* HOURS

Package designed to be used in a Jupyter Notebook setting.
```python
from sri import *

# Define the integrator
integrator = OVRVO()

# Define the potential
potential = HarmonicOscillator()
```
