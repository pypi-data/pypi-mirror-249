`PCAL9554`
====================================================

CircuitPython module for the PCAL9554 I2C I/O extenders.
The PCAL9554 is a 8 pin IO Expander. It is software compatible with the PCA9554, but has a
bunch of added functions.

Added features of these expanders include:

* Built in pull up and pull down resistors.
* Per pin selectable drive strength.
* Maskable interrupt pins
* Latching interrupt option
* Per bank push-pull/open drain pin setup.

Required library files (.py or their .mpy equivalent):

* PCAL9554.py
* PCA9554.py
* i2c_expander.py
* digital_inout.py
* helpers.py

Compatible Devices

* PCAL9554
* PCAL9538

These are devices I have specifically tested and know work. There appear to be a lot more devices
with similar naming schemes that use the same register map. These should also be compatible, but
make sure you check the i2c address and default register state.

:Note: By default if an (non-latched) interrupt enabled pin changes state, but changes back before
       the GPIO state register is read, the interrupt state will be cleared. Setting the interrupt
       latch will cause the device to latch on a state change of the input pin. With latching
       enabled, on a state change to the pin, the interrupt pin will be asserted and will not
       deassert until the input register is read. The value read from the input register will be
       the value that caused the interrupt, not nessecarially the current value of the pin. If the
       pin changed state, but changed back before the input register was read, the changed state
       will be what is returned in the register. The state change back to the original state will
       not trigger another interrupt as long as it happens before the input register is read. If
       the input register is read before the pin state changes back to the original value, both
       state changes will cause an interrupt.

Heavily based on the code written by Tony DiCola for the MCP230xx library.
