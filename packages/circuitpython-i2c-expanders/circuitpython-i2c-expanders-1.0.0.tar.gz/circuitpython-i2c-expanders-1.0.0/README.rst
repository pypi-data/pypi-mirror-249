Drivers for various I2C GPIO expanders. The library does not require any libraries other than the standard install of circuit python. Once the exapander has been initialized, the pins can be defined and interacted with in the same way as GPIOs on the CPU.

This library currently supports

* PCA9555
* PCAL9555
* PCA9554
* PCAL9554
* PCA9538
* PCAL9538

Other expanders will likely be added over time as I use them.

Based on Adafruit's library for the `MCP230xx expanders <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP230xx>`_

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Installing from PyPI
=====================
On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/circuitpython-i2c-expanders/>`_.
To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circuitpython-i2c-expanders

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install circuitpython-i2c-expanders

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install circuitpython-i2c-expanders

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install i2c_expanders

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============
Take a look in the examples folder for a basic example of using this library.
