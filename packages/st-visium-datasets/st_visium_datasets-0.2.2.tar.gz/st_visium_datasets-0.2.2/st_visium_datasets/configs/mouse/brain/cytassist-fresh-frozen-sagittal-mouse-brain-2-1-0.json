  "description": "C57/Bl6 mice were purchased from [Charles River Laboratory](https://www.criver.com/). Mice were euthanized in accordance with state regulations and subsequently tissues were harvested and prepared according to the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression for Fresh Frozenâ€“ Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000636](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/tissue-prep/visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression-for-fresh-frozen-%E2%80%93-tissue-preparation-guide)). A tissue section of 10 Âµm was placed on a standard glass slide, and H&E-stained following methanol fixation. The section was coverslipped with 85% glycerol, imaged, decoverslipped, followed by destaining as described in Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression for Fresh Frozen â€“ Fixation, H&E Staining, Imaging & Destaining Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000614](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/tissue-staining/visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression-for-fresh-frozen-%E2%80%93-methanol-fixation-h-e-staining-imaging-destaining)). The glass slide with tissue section was processed with the Visium CytAssist instrument and a slide with 11 mm Capture Area using the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit User Guide ([CG000495](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/library-construction/visium-cyt-assist-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe)).\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using Olympus VS200 Slide Scanning Microscope with these settings:\n\n- Olympus Objective magnification: 20x UPLXAPO Objective\n- Numerical Aperture: 0.8\n- ScopeLED light source: Xcite Novum\n- Camera: VS-264C\n- Exposure: 500 Âµs\n\nLibraries were prepared following the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit User Guide ([CG000495](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/library-construction/visium-cyt-assist-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe)).\n\n- Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6, flow cell HLYH7DSX5 (lane 1-4)  \n- Sequencing configuration and coverage: 28bp read 1 (16bp Visium spatial barcode, 12bp UMI), 90bp read 2 (transcript), 10bp i7 sample barcode and 10bp i5 sample barcode\n- Dual Index set: SI-TS-H6\n- Slide: V52B25-081\n- Capture Area: B",
