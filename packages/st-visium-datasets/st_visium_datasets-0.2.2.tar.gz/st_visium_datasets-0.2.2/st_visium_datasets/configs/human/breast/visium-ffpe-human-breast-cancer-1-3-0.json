  "description": "10x Genomics obtained FFPE human breast tissue from [BioIVT](https://bioivt.com) Asterand Human Tissue Specimens. The tissue was annotated with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, Invasive Carcinoma. The tissue was sectioned as described in Visium Spatial Gene Expression for FFPE â€“ Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000408](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/ffpe-v-1/steps/tissue-prep/visium-spatial-gene-expression-for-ffpe-tissue-preparation-guide)). Tissue sections of 5 Âµm were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides, then stained following Deparaffinization, H&E Staining, Imaging & Decrosslinking Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000409](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/ffpe-v-1/steps/tissue-staining/visium-spatial-gene-expression-for-ffpe-deparaffinization-hand-e-staining-imaging-and-decrosslinking)).\n\n* Block 738811QB Section 1. Grade II\n* Sex: Female\n* Ethnicity: Asian\n* Age: 73\n\nAnnotations [here](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/1.3.0/Visium_FFPE_Human_Breast_Cancer/Visium_FFPE_Human_Breast_Cancer_Pathologist_Annotations.png) were done at an overview level and were performed by Agoko NV, Belgium.\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using Metafer Slide Scanning Microscope from MetaSystems with these settings:\n\n* Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 20x objective\n* Numerical Aperture: 0.8\n* ScopeLED light source\n* MetaSystems CoolCube 4c camera\n\nLibraries were prepared following the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits for FFPE User Guide ([CG000407](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/library-prep/doc/user-guide-visium-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe-user-guide) Rev A).\n\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq, flow cell H25NJDMXY (lane 1)\n* Sequencing depth: 32,524 reads per spot\n* Sequencing configuration: 28bp read 1 (16bp Visium spatial barcode, 12bp UMI), 50bp read2 (transcript), 10bp i7 sample barcode and 10bp i5 sample barcode\n* Dual-Index set SI-TS-B12\n* Slide: V11J26-008\n* Area: B1\n\nKey metrics were:\n\n* Spots detected under tissue: 2,518\n* Median genes per spot: 5,244\n* Median reads per spot: 32,524\n",
