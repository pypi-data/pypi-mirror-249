  "description": "10x Genomics obtained FFPE mouse brain tissue from [Adlego](https://adlego.se/) and embedded by [BioIVT](https://bioivt.com). The tissue was sectioned as described in Visium Spatial Gene Expression for FFPE â€“ Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000408](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/ffpe-v-1/steps/tissue-prep/visium-spatial-gene-expression-for-ffpe-tissue-preparation-guide)). Tissue sections of 5 Âµm were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides, then stained following Deparaffinization, Decrosslinking, Immunofluorescence Staining & Imaging Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000410](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-visium-spatial-gene-expression-for-ffpe-deparaffinization-decrosslinking-immunofluorescence-staining-and-imaging)).\n\n* Sex: Male\n* Age: >8 weeks\n* Strain: C57BL/6\n* Section Orientation: Coronal\n\nAntibodies used for Immunofluorescence staining:\n\n* Channel 1 = 1:100 NeuN (Abcam, Cat. No. ab190565)\n* Channel 2 = 1:200 GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. C9205-.2ML)\n* Channel 3 = 1:5000 DAPI (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. 62248)\n* Blocking buffer: 1X PBS; 2 % BSA; 0.1 % Tween 20; 1 U/uL Roche Protector RNase Inhibitor (based on CoA)\n\nThe IF image was acquired using Metafer Slide Scanning Microscope from MetaSystems with these settings:\n\n* Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 20x objective\n* Numerical Aperture: 0.8\n* Zeiss Colibri 7 LED light source\n* MetaSystems CoolCube 4c camera\n\nLibraries were prepared following the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits for FFPE User Guide ([CG000407](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/library-prep/doc/user-guide-visium-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe-user-guide) Rev A).\n\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq, flow cell HCYTVDSX2 (lane 1-2)\n* Sequencing depth: 30,337 reads per spot\n* Sequencing configuration: 28bp read 1 (16bp Visium spatial barcode, 12bp UMI), 120bp read2 (transcript), 10bp i7 sample barcode and 10bp i5 sample barcode\n* Dual-Index set: SI-TS-A9\n* Slide: V11J26-128\n* Area: A1\n\nKey metrics were:\n\n* Spots detected under tissue: 2,438\n* Median genes per spot: 6,056\n* Median UMI Counts per spot: 17,096\n",
