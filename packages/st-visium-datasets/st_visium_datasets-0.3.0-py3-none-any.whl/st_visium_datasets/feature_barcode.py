    They essentially represent a way to organize and quantify gene expression data
    from individual cells.

    The returned dataframe is in the following format:

    - Rows = features (genes): These refer to genes or genomic regions that are being
    measured. Each row in the dataframe represents a gene or genomic region.
    Each row contains the feature id, gene name and feature type.
    - Columns = barcodes (cells): These represent individual cells. Each column in
    the dataframe corresponds to a specific cell that was sequenced.
    - The values in the df typically represent the count of RNA molecules
    (gene expression) detected for each gene in each cell. So, each cell's column
    will have counts for the various genes in the rows.
