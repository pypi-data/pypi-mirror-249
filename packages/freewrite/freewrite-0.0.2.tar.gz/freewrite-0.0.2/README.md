The concept of **freewriting** comes from the book
*Writing Without Teachers* (1973) by Peter Elbow, who has made a summary
publicly available
[here](http://peterelbow.com/pdfs/How_to_Write_Better_through_Freewriting_by_Peter_Elbow.pdf).
The point of **freewritnig** is to write for short uninterrupted bursts,
the emphasis is on continuing writing rather than on what you write.
As one is to keep on writing, there is no time to read what is written nor to
go back and make any corrections.
Mistakes in spelling, grammar, syntax etc. are to be be ignored
during the writing part of the session. *Keep going.*

It is a simple enough exercise and could just as well be done with a pen as with a keyboard.
However, it takes some extra effort to not going back and reading or editing ones text,
effort that can better be focused on writing.
This app prevents this backtracking by not showing you what you write,
until the time is up and you press the stop button.
