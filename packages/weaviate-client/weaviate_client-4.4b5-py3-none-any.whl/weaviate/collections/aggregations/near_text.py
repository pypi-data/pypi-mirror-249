        This method requires a vectoriser capable of handling text, e.g. `text2vec-contextionary`, `text2vec-openai`, etc.

        Arguments:
            `query`
                The text(s) to search on.
            `certainty`
                The minimum certainty of the text search.
            `distance`
                The maximum distance of the text search.
            `move_to`
                The vector to move the search towards.
            `move_away`
                The vector to move the search away from.
            `object_limit`
                The maximum number of objects to return from the text search prior to the aggregation.
            `filters`
                The filters to apply to the search.
            `limit`
                The maximum number of aggregated objects to return.
            `total_count`
                Whether to include the total number of objects that match the query in the response.
            `return_metrics`
                A list of property metrics to aggregate together after the text search.

        Raises:
